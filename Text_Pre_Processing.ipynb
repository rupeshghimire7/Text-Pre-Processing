Yeah, Barbie. I just fell. Fell? I’m so embarrassed. Barbie doesn’t get embarrassed. I know. Barbie, I don’t even have context for this, but my feet… my heels are on the ground. I’m no longer on tiptoes. That’s okay. Let me see. [all gasp] [screams] Flat feet! [retches] [all screaming] [retching] [sobbing] Oh, no! [retching] Stop it, Ken. I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I know I’m Stereotypical Barbie and therefore don’t form conjectures concerning the causality of adjacent unfolding events, but some things have been happening that might be related. [sighs] Bad breath this morning, a cold shower, burnt waffle, and falling off my roof. [gasps] You’re malfunctioning. What? No, I’m just, I’m… Am I? I’ve never seen this kind of malfunction before. It’s usually just hair-related. You know, you’re gonna have to visit Weird Barbie. I have never had to visit Weird Barbie. That’s because you’ve never malfunctioned. I heard that she used to be the most beautiful Barbie of all, but then someone played with her too hard in the Real World.

[thunder rumbling] [grunts] I would never wear heels if my feet were shaped this way. Hello? Woof. [gasps] Oh. [plops] Bark. [plops] Woof. Bark. Hey. What’s cookin’, good-lookin’? Hi. Welcome. Welcome to my Weirdhouse. [grunts] Hi, how are ya? Nice to meet you. Sorry about the dog crap. What can I do ya for? I just had to come see you about my feet. They’re, um… Flat. Yeah. Never seen that before. Really? Whoa. Okay. Well, can you, you know, fix them? You’re Stereotypical Barbie, right? Mmm-hmm. [chuckles] That Ken of yours, he is one nice-looking little protein pot. I guess. I’d like to see what kind of nude blob he’s packing under those jeans. [sighs] Anyway, what preceded this? Oh, nothing. A really fun game of volleyball. That’s it? Thoughts of death. What is it? [stammers] Maybe some thoughts of death? Thoughts of death! Is that a problem? Oh. What? I’ve heard of this. Of course, I didn’t think it was possible, but it’s real. Oh, you’ve done it. You’ve opened a portal. I didn’t open a portal. [chuckles] Someone did. And now, there is a rip in the continuum that is the membrane between Barbie Land and the Real World, and if you wanna be Stereotypical Barbie perfect again, then, baby girl, you gotta go fix it. Or you’re gonna keep going funny. Look at your upper thigh. [gasps] What is that? That’s cellulite. That’s gonna spread everywhere. What? And then you’re gonna start getting sad and mushy and complicated. No! [hisses] What do I have to do? You have to go to the Real World. Okay. And you have to find the girl who’s playing with you. Playing with me? We’re all being played with, babe. But usually there’s some kind of separation. Thanks. There’s the girl and the doll. And never the twain shall cross. The twain is crossing? Yes. And the girl who’s playing with you, she must be sad, and her thoughts and feelings and humanness are interfering with your dollness. Why would she be sad? We fixed everything so that all women in the Real World can be happy and powerful. I don’t know, but if you ask me, you had something to do with this, too. Me? Takes two to rip a portal. I can’t have. I’ve only ever wanted for everything to stay exactly as it is. Well, be that as it may, the two of you are becoming inextricably intertwined. And you gotta help her to help yourself. [girls’ voices echoing faintly] So, should… Whoo! So, what’ll it be then? You can go back to your regular life and forget any of this ever happened, or you can know the truth about the universe. The choice is now yours. The first one. The high heel. No. We’ll do a re-do. You’re supposed to want to know. I don’t. Mmm. Babe, listen. You have to want to know, okay? Do it again. I’m not Adventure Barbie. I’m Stereotypical Barbie. I’m like the Barbie you think of when someone says, “Think of a Barbie.” That’s me. I’m bummed. You’re a bummer. That’s a bummer. Okay, I’m ready to forget now. No! You’re doing this one! I just gave you a choice so you could feel some sense of control. So there is no option one? No! You have to fix the rip yourself. Don’t blame me, blame Mattel. They make the rules. [whining] Oh, I don’t want to. Fine, get cellulite. I don’t care. No! No, no, no. No. Okay. Yeah. [sighs] Send me through the portal. Okay. There’s actually no portal. Oh. It’s a figure of speech. It’s actually a sports car to a speedboat, to a rocket ship, to a tandem bike, to a camper van, fun, to a snowmobile, brr, which will take you most of the way to the state of Los Angeles, where you will don neon and Rollerblades, and enter the country of California. Weird, I know. Best if you don’t think about it too much. And then when I get there, how do I find this girl? You will know. Okay. And how do I get back? The same way you came, but in reverse. Like I should move forward but do the order backward or go… Don’t overthink it. Oh. Okay. For you see, if you do not find her and fix things, what’s ugly will become uglier, and what’s weird will become weirder. And then you’ll look like me. Ahh! Oh. Sorry. I understand. I set myself up for that. Anyway, I believe in you. Thank you. Go. Be careful. I love you. Bye. Bye. [crowd] Bon voyage to reality, and good luck restoring the membrane that separates our world from theirs so you don’t get cellulite! [cheering] I guess she’s going without you. You’re so lost, Ken. [laughs] She literally asked me. And I was like, “I prefer to stay here.” Why? Are you scared? No. [laughs] I bet you’re scared. And I bet she doesn’t even want you to go. Well, you bet both those things incorrectly, and I bet in the opposite direction. Yeah? Yeah. Which way is that? You don’t even know. I just don’t want to leave. I’m trying to find reasons not to leave. Please stay. I’m gonna miss you guys so much. I just wish someone could come with me, but you can’t. I should do this alone. What bird am I thinking of? Parrot. Dolphin. I mean, no, a bird. Pelican. Ohh. Man. We’ll miss you, Barbie. [Stereotypical Barbie] I’ll be back in no time, with perfect feet, and we’ll forget that this ever happened. And you’ll get to see all the good work we’ve done to fix the world. You’ll be such a hero to them. All those grateful, powerful women who owe their wonderful lives to Barbie. I’ll bet every woman will say thank you and give you a really big hug. [giggles] Yes, you’re right. Here I go. Bye. Yay! Bye, Barbie. Bye. [whooshes] [“Closer to Fine” playing] Bye, Barbie.

Barbie, what if there’s beach? You’ll need someone who’s a professional in that. Did you bring your Rollerblades? I literally go nowhere without them. Please? Okay. Wow. [chuckling] Let’s do this.

Ooh, love that! Wow! I feel kind of ill at ease. Like… I don’t know the word for it, but I’m… [man 1] Nice leotard. Conscious, but it’s myself that I’m conscious of. [Ken] I’m not getting any of that. I feel what could only be described as admired. [man 2] Damn, girl! But not ogled. [man 3] You’re hot. And there’s no undertone of violence. Mine very much has an undertone of violence. Oh, look, a construction site. We need that good feminine energy. Yeah. Ladies! Yoo-hoo. Oh. You got fries with that shake? If I said you had a hot body, would you hold it against me? [man 4] Have I died and gone to heaven? [man 5] Is that a mirror in your pocket? Baby, you are an angel. I can see myself in your shorts. I don’t know exactly what you meant with all of those little quips, but I’m picking up on some sort of entendre, which appears to be double, and I would just like to inform you, I do not have a vagina. And he does not have a penis. We don’t have genitals. That’s okay. Yeah. Yeah, whatever. Yeah. It’s cool. I have all the genitals. Geez, you would think a construction site at lunch time would be the perfect place for a little woman power, but this one was so… male. Everything is almost like… reversed here. [seagulls cawing] Oh, look! The Supreme Court. [Ken] They’re so smart. Yeah. [man 6] Yeah, bruh! Do it, bro! [slap lands] [“Chose Your Fighter” playing] [gasps] [camera shutter clicks] [camera shutter clicks] I love me a leotard. I love the elbow pads. I think we should get some different clothes. [waves crashing] [seagulls cawing] We look great. I love fringe. I love denim. Ha-ha-ha-ha! [laughs] Hey, man. You guys gotta pay for that stuff. [cop] She looks even better in more clothes. Because you can imagine more. You know what? Keep ’em. Weird Barbie said I would know how to find this girl, but I have no idea. Hmm. What would a smart Barbie do? I just need to clear my mind so I can think. Who is playing with me? I hate it when people think. I get so bored. Faster I figure it out, the faster we get to go home. What am I supposed to do? Ken! Go for a walk or something. By myself? Yes. Really? Where? Anywhere. Can I go that way? Yes. Okay. Don’t go far. Okay! [exhales] [man] Excuse me, sir. Thanks, man. [“Also Sprach Zarathustra” funk remix playing] [man] What’s up, man? We’ve got to man up on this one. Great workout, man. [both in unison] Men, men, men. You’re the man! No, you’re the man!

[chuckles] Barbie! Barbie! Yes! [both] I’ve got it! Oh, what do you got? You go first. No, no, you go. We’ll go at the same time. Okay. She’s at school. Men rule the world! What was that? The kid’s at the school? But what did you say? Nothing. Okay. Well, let’s go to the school. Okay! Now, come on. [phone rings] Hello. This is Dan of the FBI. Oh. This is Aaron at Mattel. I don’t give a flying squirrel who you are, Aaron. What are you, like an intern? No, I’m… Two of your dolls have gotten loose. Impossible. How do you know? Don’t sass me, Aaron. Couple of blondes, answering to Barbie and Ken. Rollerblading in Santa Monica. We’re gonna need Mattel’s help landing the eagle. Don’t crap the bed, Aaron! I won’t. [line disconnects] This is bad. This is really bad. What? [stammering] This happened before. What? When? I heard about ten years ago, a woman named Skipper turned up at some family’s home in Key West. Asked to babysit the kids. She then tried to take their toddler surfing. Geez. I know. They were able to straighten it out, keep it under wraps, but this is serious. I’m going all the way up. No one goes all the way up. I have to. You may never come back. I know. [humming] ♪ Closer I am to fine [humming] Oh. Hey. Oh, hi, Aaron. New drawings? Yeah. I just started drawing these weird designs. [Aaron] These are different. It’s Irrepressible Thoughts of Death Barbie. Full Body Cellulite Barbie. Crippling Shame Barbie. Okay. Listen, I have to speak to the top brass. No. I must. No. I’m going to. Aaron, they’re in a big corporate idea sesh. No one is to be admitted. Aaron! Aaron! Aaron, stop! Always be empowering girls. Always! But what do we really sell? I’ll tell you what. We sell dreams. [Sasha’s mom whispering] Aaron. And imagination! And sparkle! I get excited. I’m passionate. And when you think of sparkle, what do you think of after that? Female agency. Excuse me. Who are you? Aaron Dinkins, sir. We’re in the middle of a major sit-down here, Aaron Dinkins. I think you’re gonna want to hear this, sir. Can you just e-mail it? And you can send it to me EOD. [whispering] End of day. [chuckles] That’s cool. Yeah. [stammers] May I put it in a whisper, sir? Fine. Whisper me. [whispers] [drumsticks tapping] [all whispering] [chuckles] [whispering] No. No! Ahh! Ahh! No. [man 1] Get the chair! [man 2] Take the cart. [man 3] They’re okay. You all right? He’s okay. Okay. He’s okay. [exhales] It’s a repeat of Skipper in Key West. And with all due respect, that was Skipper, sir. This is… Barbie. [sighs] If this got out that our dolls were coming to Los Angeles from Barbie Land as life-size versions of themselves… [panting] roaming the earth… this would be very bad. Barbie in the Real World? That’s impossible. We’ve got a definite situation on our hands. Catastrophic! I can’t stress that enough! What? What’s your name again? Aaron Dinkins, sir. Aaron Dickinson? Dinkins. Yes! Aaron. Is Barbie Land like an alternate reality or is it like a place where your imagination… [all] Yes! Okay. Think of it as a town in Sweden, Aaron Dinkins. [all] Sweden. Right. [sighs] How much do you weigh? It doesn’t matter. [clears throat] Sounds like a job for the box. No one rests until this doll is back in a box. [school bell rings] [Barbie] Look, Davy Crockett Junior High School, just like I saw in my vision. [Ken] A man on a horse. I’ve started to get all these weirdo feelings. Like, I have fear with no specific object. What is that? It’s anxiety. I have it too. They’re just awful at this age. I feel amazing. [chuckles] That’s because kids don’t take it out on the dads. [Barbie] She’s gotta be here somewhere. I need to find her soon. I’m just gonna pop into the library and see if I can find any books on trucks. [chuckles] Okay, just don’t get in trouble. I won’t!

Everyone really likes me and thinks I’m cool and pretty. Huh. Thank you. Hey, ladies. Sasha, what’s up? [exclaims] Who are you? [laughs] I’m only your favorite woman of all time. Barbie! [laughs] You really think you’re Barbie? Yeah. She’s crazy. Do you think she escaped from like an insane asylum? So you’re like “Barbie” Barbie? Like a professional bimbo? No. Barbie’s not a bimbo. Barbie is a doctor and a lawyer and a senator and a Nobel Prize winner. You’re a Nobel Prize winner? Oh. No, not me, but Barbie is. Yeah. Aren’t you guys gonna thank me and give me a big hug? [laughs] For being your favorite toy? We haven’t played with Barbie since we were like five years old. Yeah, I hated dolls with hair. I mean, I’d play with Barbie, but it was, like, the last resort. I loved Barbie. [clears throat] Oh. Anyways, even then, it was horrible for us. It was horrible? Why? Come on, Sasha. Give it to her. Destroy Barbie. [sighs] Okay, Barbie, let’s do this. You’ve been making women feel bad about themselves since you were invented. I think you have that the wrong way around. You represent everything wrong with our culture. Sexualized capitalism, unrealistic physical ideals… No, no, no. You’re describing something stereotypical. Barbie is so much more than that. Look at yourself. Well, I am technically Stereotypical Barbie. You set the feminist movement back 50 years. You destroy girls’ innate sense of worth and you are killing the planet with your glorification of rampant consumerism. No, I’m supposed to help you and make you happy and powerful. Oh, I am powerful. And until you showed up here and declared yourself Barbie, I hadn’t thought about you in years, you fascist! Oh. Um… Okay. It’s happening again. [laughing] I have to… Will you excuse me? It was really nice talking to you. They never listen. Excuse me, sir, do you have the time? You respect me. Sorry, no, do you know what time it is? No, I do not. [laughs] Okay. Why didn’t Barbie tell me about patriarchy, which, to my understanding, is where men and horses run everything? Sure. I shall seek my fortune there. All right. So… I’ll take a high-level, high-paying job with influence, please. Okay, you’ll need at least an MBA. And a lot of our people have PhDs. Isn’t being a man enough? Actually, right now, it’s kind of the opposite. You guys are clearly not doing patriarchy very well. [laughing] No! No. We’re, uh… We’re doing it well, yeah. We just… hide it better now. Oh. No, I won’t let you do just one appendectomy. But I’m a man. But not a doctor. Please? No. Can I talk to a doctor? You are talking to a doctor. Can you get me a coffee? No. And I need a clicky pen. No. And a white coat. No. And a sharp thing. No. There he is. Doctor! Somebody get security. I’d like to apply for your job of beach. So, you want to be a lifeguard? Oh. I’m not trained to go over there. I’m trained to stand confidently right here. There’s nobody in danger here. And even if there were, I’m not trained to save them. [chuckles] Then I can’t hire you. I can’t even beach here! [sobbing] She thinks I’m a fascist? I don’t control the railways or the flow of commerce. [sobs] There you are. Oh, no. That went terrible. I need to find somewhere where I can start patriarchy fresh. Miss Barbie? [sniffling] It’s just Barbie. We’re gonna need you to come with us. Oh. Who are you? We’re Mattel. Mattel? Mattel. Oh, thank goodness! I’ve gotta talk to somebody in charge. Everything is backwards here. Men look at me like I’m an object. Girls hate me. Everyone thinks I’m crazy, and I keep getting arrested. Need you to step this way, ma’am. I also just learned to cry. First, I got one tear and then I got a whole bunch. What do I do? Do I follow Barbie into that scary unmarked black truck car? A truck car I’d like to have, actually. You’re right, she’s fine. It’s Mattel. [chuckles] Yeah. I know. I’ll go back to Barbie Land, and I’ll tell the Kens what I’ve learned. Oh, it’s going to be beautiful! [chuckles] Okay. Back to Barbie Land. Let’s go that way. Hi, Bunny Boo-Boo. Don’t call me that. Sorry. I’m off early because of a crisis at work, but I thought we could go get some soft serve. Thank God they arrested that nutjob. Um, um… that reality-challenged woman. She thinks she’s Barbie. Wait, what did you say? She thinks she’s Barbie. She’s, like, fully convinced. [gasps] What are you doing? What are you doing? Mom. Mom! Mom, get back in the car! Are you kidding me? Mom! Mattel! Of course it was you guys that brought me here. Because it definitely wasn’t that Sasha girl. Thanks for the ride. This has been so much fun. [gasps] Wow, the mothership! [door hisses] [gasping] Barbie! We’re so happy to see you. Hi! [man] Would you like some mineral water? Yes, thank you. Oh, thanks. I’m not used to that having anything in it. [men laughing] [Barbie] Thank you. So, we’ve been very anxious to get some quality face-time with you. Of course. So what can I do to repair the rift in the space-time continuum, get my feet back, and that one cellulite gone, and just generally not turn into Weird Barbie? We have been discussing that very topic. If you’re agreeable to it, we would love it if you could just get into that giant box. Get into the box and you’ll go back to Barbie Land. And everything will be as it was. You know what? We should probably get Ken first. Ken? [confused chatter] Ken. You know, Ken. Barbie and Ken. [chuckles] Oh! Yes, Ken. Yeah. Ken. The guy. Yeah. [panting] Back to Barbie Land! [laughs] I’m gonna be sick. I’m gonna be sick. [retches] Ken isn’t something we’re worried about. Ever. Okay, I’ll just, um… I’ll get in the box then. All right! Yes! [applauding] Oh. But since I came all this way, could I just meet the woman in charge, your CEO? Oh, that would be me. Oh. Your CFO. Me. Your COO. Here. President of the Barbie division. Present. I’m a man with no power. Does that make me a woman? Are any women in charge? Listen, I know exactly where you’re going with this, and I have to say I really resent it. We are a company literally made of women. We had a woman CEO in the ’90s. And there was another one… at some other time. So that’s… That’s two right there. Women are the freaking foundation of this very long phallic building. We have gender-neutral bathrooms up the wazoo. Every single one of these men love women. I’m the son of a mother. I’m the mother of a son. I’m… I’m the nephew of a woman aunt. Some of my best friends are Jewish. What I’m trying to say is… Get in the box, you Jezebel! [men exclaiming] What? I can’t say Jezebel now? I haven’t been in a box in ages. See? It’s easy. Oh, okay. Huh. Oh, my gosh. I remember this smell. [gasps] I’m having a real Proustian flashback. Remember Proust Barbie? That did not sell very well. [chuckles] [twist ties creaking] Oh! Ha-ha! You know what? Um, before I get in the box, could I just run to the restroom and make sure my hair is perfect? Fine. Can you be speedy about it? Mmm-hmm. [door whirring] Down this way? It’s just down the hallway. Thank you. [Mattel CEO] On the right.

Are you shining with a real Barbie? No! I mean, maybe. Like a little, yes. [sighs] I don’t even know where to start with this wishing-a-Barbie-to-life crap. Oh, Sasha, listen. I’m just a boring mom with a boring job and a daughter who hates me. Can you blame me for wanting to have a little fun? [engines revving] I gotta lose these chuckleheads. [chimes] [engine revving] [Barbie] Ahh! [Sasha] Mom! [upbeat rock music playing] I think I owe you ladies an apology. I thought that Barbie had made the Real World better, but the Real World is forever and irrevocably messed up! Well, the Real World is not perfect, but you inspired me. I love women. I want to help women. Oh, come off it, everybody hates women. Women hate women, and men hate women. It’s the one thing we can all agree on. Is that true? It’s complicated. Hate is a strong word. Wake up, Mom! [brakes screech] I am wide awake, Sasha! [gasps] Mom, where did you learn to drive like this? There was this guy. Was it Dad? Yeah, yeah, it was… It was Dad. [engines revving] [tires screech] [Sasha’s mom whispers] Okay, duck. [whispering] You look so pretty. Don’t look at me. Okay, sorry. [gasps] [sighs] I can’t hold them off forever. Where can we go? [gasps] Wait, I have an idea. Can you get us to Venice Beach? Sure can. Ah! I love Rollerblades. Where are we going? Barbie Land. [Sasha] What? Mom! Are you really gonna let Barbie take you and your tween daughter to an imaginary land? Yes, and you wanna know why? Because I never get to do anything. I didn’t even go on that cruise I won at your school raffle because I didn’t have enough vacation days and your dad’s allergic to sun. Oh. What about Dad? We can’t just leave him! He’ll be fine. Bolígrafos. [voice on app] Bolígrafos. Bolígrafos. [correct answer chimes] Yeah, yeah. He’ll be fine. Ready for fun? Yes! Great! Here we go! Come on and feel the magic. [“Journey To The Real World” instrumental playing] [Sasha’s mom gasps] Where are we? How did we get into these clothes? How did we get into this vehicle? When I was a kid, I lost these boots and my mom wouldn’t let me buy a whole new Barbie just to replace the boots. They look so good on you. Why, thank you. Hey, you! She was always my favorite Barbie. You’re my favorite human. Don’t tell him, but I never got a Ken. That’s because Ken is totally superfluous. [Sasha’s mom laughing] [gasps] I didn’t say that. Women hold all major positions of power, control all the money. Basically, everything that men do in your world, women do in ours. [Sasha’s mom gasps] I mean, that sounds kind of cool. Sasha, look, dolphins! [all chuckling] [“Closer to Fine” playing] ♪ Closer I am to fine ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ Closer I am to fine ♪ [yells] What is this song? Oh, and we have a female president and it’s fun and work and friendship and female 24/7. [Sasha] Do giant hands come in and play with you? [Barbie] No, that’s crazy. Excuse me. Have you seen a group of women on wheels? Actually, yeah, there was a blonde, a brunette and a tween. They Rollerbladed in that direction. Oh, no. First step is always Rollerblading. [Aaron] Excuse me, sir? They’ve gone to Barbie Land. Oh, no. And she’s brought humans there with her. This could mean extremely weird things for our world. Like what? Nothing any of our collective imaginations could ever dream up. A podcast hosted by two wise trees. Or a choir of 2,000 young fathers. Not even close. We’ve got to get to Barbie Land. Go! Find some blades now! Just pick a direction and run! I can practically feel my heels lifting already. Yes! This is what I was supposed to do. Bring you back here. It feels right. It does. Okay, this is… Oh. That’s strange. [cheerleaders cheering] [shouting and cheering] [“Man I Am” playing] ♪ ‘Cause that’s the man I am ♪ ♪ Baby, treat me right ♪ Incoming brewski beer. [mimics airplane] So, that’s our president, with the beer. And the cheering squad is the Supreme Court. This is so much better than being president. Something’s weird today. [water bubbling] Hi, Barbie! Oh, okay. Hi, Ken. Have a brewski beer. My big guy is thirsty. Ah. Anyway, uh… Wait until you see my Dreamhouse. Everything I’ve bought and own will totally inspire you. And we can change clothes again! That’s the Capitol. [Sasha’s mom] Ah! It’s pink? Pink! And that’s the… [horse neighing] [Sam Smith] ♪ You think That women rule the world ♪ [Barbie] These are the Dreamhouses. This is where I live. [Sasha’s mom] You can see through the houses. So does each Barbie, like, have their own house? Mmm-hmm. That’s cool. Where do the Kens stay? I don’t know. At first I thought the Real World was run by men. And then there was a minute where I thought it was run by horses. But then I realized that horses are just men extenders. [Kens] Oh! [Pompadour Ken] Hmm? Oh. I had that treehouse. I saved up my allowance to buy it. [Barbie] I’ve never seen a car like that before. What happened here? Everything, basically everything exists to expand and elevate the presence of men. That’s amazing. That’s beautiful. I know. [other Ken 1] Barbie’s here. [other Ken 2] Uh-oh. Ken? [laughs nervously] What have you done? What are you wearing? Don’t question it. Just roll with it, tiny baby. [other Ken] Tiny baby. Don’t call me baby. What about mini-baby? Like this mini-fridge. [Kens laugh] No, Ken. This is my Dreamhouse. It is my Dreamhouse! It’s mine! No, this is no longer Barbie’s Dreamhouse. This shall henceforth be known as Ken’s Mojo Dojo Casa House. You don’t have to say dojo and house. And casa… But you do because it feels good. Try it. [both] Mojo Dojo Casa… No, girls. Don’t say it. Mojo Dojo Casa House. [laughs] [Mattel CEO] Give it to me straight. How weird is it? Whoa, boss, these Mojo Dojo Casa Houses are literally flying off the shelves. The kids are clamoring for them. Ken is on T-shirts, mugs. It’s the number one tattoo. [Mattel CEO] Oh, no. Warner Bros. have started auditions for the Ken movie, which is already a blockbuster hit. [laughs] It’s happening. That thing we could never imagine. If we don’t get my words lady… Executive Assistant. My Executive Words Lady and someone who’s probably her daughter back here and close the portal, our worlds could be altered forever. Well, what does it matter if it’s Barbie or Ken? The money is pouring in. Shame on you, Executive Number Two. You think I spent my entire life in boardrooms because of a bottom line? No! I got into this business because of little girls and their dreams. In the least creepy way possible. Now, blade faster. Time is running out. Look, I’m just having some brewski beers at my Mojo Dojo Casa House. [all gasp] Ken! You can stay if you want, as my bride wife, or my long-term-lowcommitment-distance girlfriend. What do you say? Ugh. Brewski beer me? I will not brewski beer you. Ha-ha-ha. That’s fine. You know, now that you Barbies aren’t around to run everything, we can do our hair however we like. I have hats. Where are my hungry boys? Who wants snacks? Barbie, I am so happy to see you. Can you believe what is happening? I know. Isn’t it great? Anyone need a brewski beer? What are you doing? You’re a doctor. I like being a helpful decoration. And Allan likes to help me give all the Kens foot massages. No, I don’t, I don’t like that. [both] We love it. Ugh, so gross. I’m so blotto-faced day-drunk right now. [laughs] Ditto same-same that. [Brunette Barbie 2] I like not having to make any decisions. It’s like a spa day for my brain. Forever. What is wrong with them? We just explained to them the immaculate, impeccable seamless garment of logic that is patriarchy, and they crumbled. Oh, my God. This is like in the 1500s with the indigenous people and smallpox. They had no defenses against it. Yeah. Buckle up, babe. [chuckles] Because Barbie Land is now Ken Land. And it’s gonna be just like Century City in Los Angeles, because they had it all figured out in Century City. The minute you get out of your car, you’re like, “I can’t believe how great this place is!” No, no, no. They don’t have it figured out in Century City because we failed them. [loudly] No! You failed me! [sighs] [melancholy music playing] [breath trembles] Out there, I was somebody. And when I walked down the street… people respected me just for who I am. [scoffs] One lady, she even asked me for the time. No way! Way. [chuckles] And if it weren’t for these technicalities like MBAs, medical degrees, and I don’t know, swim lessons, I could have ruled that world. But I don’t need any of those things here. [chuckles lightly] [car bonnet squeaking] Here, I’m just a dude. And you know what? That’s enough. TV remote. Which one is it? Oh, it’s that one right there. [Reporter Barbie laughs] [TV Ken] Call me Mister Ken President Prime Minister, ma’am. Let’s recap all the amazing changes and innovations thanks to the Kens. The Nobel Prize in horses goes to… [audience Ken] Ken! [applause] [audience chanting] Ken! Ken! Ken! Ken! Ken! [gasps] [Reporter Barbie] Wow. And now you’re making it permanent with a special election to change the Constitution. That’s right. In just 48 hours, all the Kens will head to the polls and vote to change the Constitution to a government for the Kens, of the Kens, and by the Kens! [cymbals crash] [upbeat music playing on keyboard] You can’t do this. This is Barbie Land. The Barbies worked hard and they dreamed hard to make it everything that it is. You… You can’t just undo it in a day. Literally and figuratively, watch me. Now, if you’ll excuse me… this is my Mojo Dojo Casa House, it’s not Barbie’s Mojo Dojo Casa House. Right? [gasps] [somber music playing] How’s that feel? It is not fun, is it? [Barbies and Kens] It’s boys’ night! [all cheering] Every night is boys’ night. [Kens chanting] Go, Ken! Go, Ken! Go, Ken! [Kens cheering] [crying] Barbie! Take your lady fashions with you. Take your Celebrate Disco Bell Bottoms… [ding] [Barbie] Oh! [Ken] …and your Ice Capades Pretty Practice Suit and Dazzling Show Skirt. [gasps] These are archival. Your Pajama Jam in Amsterdam sets. [Barbie] No! And your Pretty Paisley Palazzo Pants! Not the Palazzos! And get out! [crying] [Sasha’s mom] Maybe this could fit me. Honey. Why did you wish me to your messed-up world using your complicated human thoughts and feelings? What? Barbie Land was perfect before. I was perfect before. I’m so sorry. I wasn’t trying to do anything. [objects clattering] Don’t apologize. Don’t blame my mom. [Sasha’s mom] Aw, Sasha, that’s sweet. Maybe you wished us. Maybe it’s your fault, Barbie. [Barbie] No, I didn’t wish anything. I’ve never wanted anything to change. Oh, honey, that’s life. It’s all change. That’s… That’s terrifying. [somber music playing] I don’t want that. [music swelling] Not my life. No, thank you. Just, no, I don’t want this. [sighs] I’m just gonna sit here and wait and hope that one of the more leadership-oriented Barbies just snaps out of it and does something about this whole mess. I really understand this feeling. It’s basically, like, being a human person all the time… Please just leave me here. Just leave me. Go back to your messed-up world and just leave me to mine. So, you’re just gonna give up? [Barbie] Yes. [body squeaking] Okay. [Sasha] You know, I almost feel bad for you, but you are exactly what I thought you were. Um… Let’s go, honey. Let’s just… Okay, how do we… How do you expect… Do everything we did in reverse. Unbelievable. Come on, Mom. She doesn’t deserve you. [sighs] This is the lowest I’ve ever been. Emotionally and physically. [cheerful music playing] [girl] Okay, kids, it’s time to run out and get the new Depression Barbie. She wears sweatpants all day and night. She spent seven hours today on Instagram, looking at her estranged best friend’s engagement photos, while eating a family-size bag of Starbursts. And now her jaw is killing her. And she’s going to watch the BBC’s Pride and Prejudice for the seventh time until she falls asleep. Situation of our families is such that any alliance between us must be regarded as a highly reprehensible connection. [girl] Anxiety, panic attacks, and OCD sold separately. [Weird Barbie] Barbie. Barbie, wake up. Hey. [female voice] Weird. I’m like you now. Ugly and unwanted. Thanks. Let’s get her in the back. Come on. One, two… [tandem bike bell rings] Isn’t this great? [executives] Yes.

No, Allan. You can’t go. Having a Barbie in the Real World is what caused all these problems in the first place. Not one person would care if Allan was in the Real World. In fact, it’s happened before. All of ♪NSYNC, Allan. Yes, even him, so come on! [Worker Ken] Hey, you there. What do we do? Just get in the car and keep it singing. Hey, man. What?

Even if… Even if you can’t make it perfect, you can make it better. I can’t make anything better. I’m the one who ruined Barbie Land with my stupid drawings in the first place. They’re not stupid! They’re amazing! You like my drawings? They’re weird and dark and crazy. Everything you pretend not to be. I am, I am. I’m weird and I’m dark and I’m crazy. [groaning] Easy. Easy. Okay. You want some more Allan? [Kens gasp] We have to get out of here right now. Shut up, Allan! We’re going back. Let’s go get my doll. [snapping fingers] [both sigh] I’ll never get out of here. [Sasha] Where do we find Barbie? [Allan] There’s only one place she’d be. [Blonde Barbie] You’re a writer. This is your Nobel Prize. Remember winning it? Huh. It’s useless trying to deprogram her. I already did everything I could. Oh, my God. I don’t even know how I got here. I don’t deserve this. Um, I’d like to thank Ken. -[Weird Barbie gags] -[Writer Barbie] Thank you, Ken. I love you, Ken. The fork in my soup is this, Barb. Why didn’t the brainwashing work on you? [Barbie] My exposure to the Real World must have made me immune. Either you’re brainwashed, or you’re weird and ugly. There is no in between. Sing it, sister. Well, get ready, kids. Because in 48 hours, Barbie Land becomes Ken Land. [door opens] [Allan] Come on, gang. We’ll find Barbie at the top of these stairs. The Kens. They’ve found us. [all clamoring] [body squeaking] [Writer Barbie] Ken! No! Get back. [Writer Barbie] Ken. Oh. Oh! [shushing] [Sasha’s mom] Hello? Hmm? Humans. We’re fine. [Barbies] Ah. And Allan. [Barbies] Hmm. Come into my Weirdhouse. Hi! I’m Weird Barbie. I’m in the splits, I have a funky haircut, and I smell like basement. Oh, my God. I had a Weird Barbie. Yeah, you did. You make them weird by playing too hard. That’s cool. [gasps] That’s Sugar Daddy Ken. And Earring Magic Ken. Mattel discontinued them. Sugar Daddy? No, no, no. I’m not a sugar daddy. This is Sugar, and I’m her daddy. And I have an earring. A magic earring. These were actual Kens. [gasps] More discontinued Barbies. Growing Up Skipper? May I? Okay. [Sasha’s mom] Watch this. [air hisses] Her boobs grow. Why would they do that? [Sasha’s mom] And Barbie Video Girl. I have a TV in my back. You know whose dream that is? Nobody. Nobody’s dream. And that’s Barbie Barbie, of course. She’s not dead. She’s just having an existential crisis. [Sasha’s mom] Okay, come on. Hey. What’s wrong? [crying] I’m not pretty anymore. What? You’re so pretty. I’m not Stereotypical Barbie pretty. [narrator] Note to the filmmakers. Margot Robbie is the wrong person to cast if you want to make this point. But you’re beautiful. It’s not just that. I’m not… smart enough to be interesting. You’re so smart. I can’t do brain surgery, I’ve never flown a plane. [Sasha’s mom scoffs] I’m not the president. No one on the Supreme Court is me. I’m not good enough for anything. [crying softly] It is literally impossible to be a woman. You are so beautiful and so smart, and it kills me that you don’t think you’re good enough. Like we have to always be extraordinary. But somehow, we’re always doing it wrong. [sighs] You have to be thin but not too thin, and you can never say you want to be thin. You have to say you want to be healthy, but also you have to be thin. You have to have money, but you can’t ask for money because that’s crass. [sighs] You have to be a boss but you can’t be mean. You have to lead, but you can’t squash other people’s ideas. You’re supposed to love being a mother, but don’t talk about your kids all the damn time. You have to be a career woman but also always be looking out for other people. You have to answer for men’s bad behavior, which is insane, but if you point that out, you’re accused of complaining. You’re supposed to stay pretty for men but not so pretty that you tempt them too much or that you threaten other women because you’re supposed to be a part of the sisterhood but always stand out. And always be grateful. But never forget that the system is rigged, so find a way to acknowledge that but also always be grateful. You have to never get old, never be rude, never show off, never be selfish, never fall down, never fail, never show fear, never get out of line. It’s too hard, it’s too contradictory, and nobody gives you a medal or says thank you. And it turns out, in fact, that not only are you doing everything wrong but also everything is your fault. [sighs] I’m just so tired of watching myself and every single other woman tie herself into knots so that people will like us. And if all of that is also true for a doll just representing a woman… then I don’t even know. Wait. I did write a book. It’s like I’ve been in a dream, where I was somehow really invested in the Zack Snyder cut of Justice League. But what you said broke me out of it. Really? Yeah. You’re back. She’s back. By giving voice to the cognitive dissonance required to be a woman under the patriarchy, you robbed it of its power. Yes. Wow, I just said all of that. Hell, yes, White Savior Barbie! No, it was your mom. Your mom did the saving. We have to stop the Kens. And you need to say all of those things to the other Barbies. That’s the key. Got it. But how are we gonna get the Barbies away from their Kens? We have experience with a world like this one. Do you have a map of Barbie Land? What do you think? [whirring] Wow. [Weird Barbie] Thanks. I built it. Okay, here’s the deal. It’s not just about how they see us, it’s about how they see themselves. Ken Land contains the seeds of its own destruction. First we have to get the Barbies away from their Kens. We could use a decoy Barbie who pretends to be brainwashed. That should be you. Cool. [rousing pop music playing] [Sasha] Distract them by appearing helpless and confused. Kens cannot resist a damsel in distress. [Sasha’s mom] You have to make them believe that you’re complacent. That they have the power. And when their guard is down, you take the power back. The influence that Porsche 356 has had on the motoring world as a whole, it can’t be overstated. Oh! Photoshop is so hard! I just don’t understand how to use the Select tool. Honey, you can only use the Select tool if the layer is highlighted. Let me show you. My tiny head is just swimming with technical jargon like color bands… Oh! Hi. And magnetic lassos and bit maps. Do you think that you and your strong arms can explain… Oh! What’s happening? [Barbie] Allan, go around! [President Barbie] Ahh! Oh, but what about Ken? No, no, no! No, but I love him! [Barbie] Come on, Allan! [President Barbie] Hey! What’s gonna happen to Ken? [Sasha’s mom] Just listen. You have to be their mommies but not remind them of their mommy. Any power you have must be masked under a giggle. [ding] What happened? One minute I was president, and the next I was cutting a Ken steak for him. Welcome back, Madam President. Then we’ll recruit the now unbrainwashed Barbies to our cause. [Barbie] They can be the new decoys. [Sasha’s mom] You can tell him that you’ve never seen The Godfather. And that you’d love them to explain it to you. Ooh, are you guys watching The Godfather? The Godfather. I’ve never seen it. Oh, my God. You’ve never seen The Godfather? This movie is a rich blend of Coppola‘s aesthetic genius and a triumph for Robert Evans and the architecture of the ’70s studio system. [President Barbie] Can you start the movie over and just talk through the whole thing? You have to find a way to reject men’s advances without damaging their egos. Because if you say yes to them, you’re a tramp, but if you say no to them, you’re a prude. [dings] I don’t wanna touch a foot. No, you don’t. Another one, be confused about money. I just have all my money in a savings account. That’s totally wrong. You need treasury bonds, corporate bonds, CDs. No one has CDs anymore. Oh, sweetheart, you are so cute when you’re confused. But no, not music. CD stands for Certificate of Deposit. Stephen Malkmus really harnessed the acerbic talk-singing of Lou Reed with post-punk influences such as Wire and The Fall. [dings] What am I wearing? I would never choose this. Because you’re a physicist. Do you want some pants? Yeah. [dinging] [gasps] Welcome back, Barbie. Gee, I am so awkward and don’t feel pretty at all, and will anyone ever like me? [Sasha] Or distract them with the old standby. Wearing glasses so they can discover that you’re pretty. May I? Sure. Go ahead. There. Now we can see your beautiful face. And then there’s pretending to be terrible at every sport ever. Here, let me show you. Here, let me show you. Here, let me show you. Here, let me show you. [Kens] Here, let us show you. We’ll do this until every single Barbie is deprogrammed and ready to take back Barbie Land. Yes! Yes! Yeah! [whistles] Hey! Tomorrow the Kens vote to change the Constitution, so we have to get there first. The final stage of our plan, to turn the Kens against each other. Now that they think they have power over you, you make them question whether they have enough power over each other. What if this doesn’t work? What if he doesn’t… like me anymore? He likes you. He was really upset. Because he likes you. And because he knows deep down that you don’t like him the same way. It still doesn’t mean I want to hurt him. He took your house. He brainwashed your friends. He wants to control the government. True. [Sasha’s mom] Girl. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. It’s like I’m a woman already. [Sasha’s mom] Welcome. Is this what it’s like? [groans] It’s time. I’m ready. Thank you. Here I go. [doorbell rings] Hi. [objects shuffling] [objects clattering] [Ken] Ahh! [objects clatter] Oh, hey. You’ve caught me reading. Oh. I’ve been thinking. Mm-hmm. [Barbie] Ken Land. Kendom. Kendom. Kendom Land. Land of the… Land of the free and the men. Right. Well, this place is… [Ken] Kendom Land. Really great. And the Kens really are just better at ruling than the Barbies ever were. Well, we just took patriarchy and you know, made a patriarchy. Yeah, well, I was thinking… Yes? I’m ready to be your long-term-distance low-commitment casual girlfriend, if you’ll still have me. Would you just hold on for one second? [Barbie] Oh, okay. [Ken, loudly] Sublime! I don’t know. I’m gonna have to think about that. [Barbie] Oh. Please? Okay. Come on in. I’ll play the guitar at you. Oh, yay!

No, against the Kens. But we are the Kens. The other Kens. We should probably call them something else so it doesn’t get confusing. No, because we’ll know what we mean. But when we’re on the battlefield and you say “Ken at four o’clock,” how will I know if you mean us Kens or the other Kens? Because, my dudes, we attack at ten o’clock and take advantage of the morning waves. But not so early ’cause we’re gonna want to sleep in. Right. But what will we fight with? We have no guns.

All those in favor of letting Barbie Land be Barbie Land, say “Aye.” [Barbies] Aye! [all cheering] [uplifting music playing] I’m so happy. [Barbies chanting] Go, Barbie! Go, Barbie! Go, Barbie! Go, Barbie! Go, Barbie! Go, Barbie! Go, Barbie! Go, Barbie! [Kens galloping] Is it just my imagination, or did these Mojo Dojo Casa Houses just get dreamier? That’s because they’re Dreamhouses, mother… [bleep]. [Kens gasp] [President Barbie] That’s right. We’ve reinstated the Barbie Land Constitution to what it should be. And restored all the Barbies’ brains and autonomy. [Barbies cheering] Yes! And we seriously disinfected those houses. What do we do? [Ken breathing heavily] [in deep voice] Kens! Who are we attacking, sir? No… [Ken chuckles nervously] No… [cries dramatically] Don’t look at me! [whispering] Is he crying? Just give us a minute. [Ken sobbing in distance] [breath shudders] Ken. [continues sobbing] Are you okay? Yeah. Totally. [Barbie] It’s okay if you’re crying. You know, I cried too. It’s actually kind of amazing. [Ken] I’m a liberated man. I know crying is not weak. [Barbie] Okay. [crying softly] You wanna sit up for a minute? [grunts] [sighs] This, uh… It was hard running stuff. I didn’t love it. [cries] I get it. [exhales] And those mini-fridges are so small. [Barbie] Mm-hmm. You could only fit a six pack in them. [crying] And the freezers are basically useless. To be honest, when I found out that patriarchy wasn’t about horses, I lost interest anyway. That’s okay. [sniffles] I always thought this would be our house. [chuckles] Oh. [Ken sobs loudly] Ken. [sobbing and muttering] I think I owe you an apology. Huh? I’m really sorry I took you for granted. Oh. Not every night had to be girls’ night. [sighs] Thank you for saying that. [sniffles] Thank you. Oh. I didn’t mean to suggest, uh… I just don’t know who I am without you. You’re Ken. But it’s “Barbie and Ken.” There is no just “Ken.” That’s why I was created. I only exist within the warmth of your gaze. Without it, I’m just another blond guy who can’t do flips. [dramatic music plays] [grunts] [crowd gasps] [gasping] Maybe it’s time to discover who Ken is. Okay. I think I get it now. Okay. [chuckles] No, no, no! This isn’t the answer. [smacks] [crowd gasps] [Ken] I feel so stupid. [Pompadour Ken] No. [Tall Ken] No. [crying] I look so stupid. [Barbies] Yeah. I look so stupid! No! [crying] So cool. You look so cool. Okay. Ken, you have to figure out who you are without me. [sighs] Why? You’re not your girlfriend. You’re not your house, you’re not your mink. Beach? [Barbie] Nope. You’re not even beach. Maybe all the things that you thought made you you aren’t… really you. Maybe it’s Barbie and… it’s Ken. Ken is… me? Yes. Ken is me! And I’m Barbie. [soft uplifting music playing] Ken… is me! Ken is me! Ken is me! Ken is me! [Ken laughs] I don’t even care about being Ken anymore. I just miss my friend Barbie! That’s cool! Barbie! [gasps] I’m right here. Ken! [ding] [dramatic musical sting] I want you to have it. Aw. That’s nice. [sentimental music playing] We were only fighting because we didn’t know who we were. Ken is me! [laughing] [Mattel CEO laughing] Ken is right. It’s just so hard to be a leader. You know? That’s my boss. It’s… [screams] Oh. Midge, gosh. I thought we discontinued her. [panting] Look, do you know how many times I’ve wanted to stand up in a board meeting and just say, “Can we just tickle each other?” Really? Let’s have a company retreat and just tickle each other. [executives laughing] Someone get me. Someone get me. [all laughing] I love being tickled. [Kens laugh] No, no, no. Don’t hug me. Don’t hug me. [sighs] But thanks to the Barbies, I, too, can now relieve myself of this heavy existential burden while holding on to the very real title of CEO. And we can restore everything in Barbie Land to exactly the way it was. Mister Mattel, I just… Please. Call me Mother. No, thank you. I don’t think that things should go back to the way that they were. No Barbie or Ken should be living in the shadows. Or Allan. Hey. Me? Yeah. Oh. Hello. I just want to say, I’m sorry we called you Weird Barbie behind your back and also to your face. That’s okay. I’m owning it. Would you like a job in my cabinet? May I please have sanitation? It’s yours. Yeah, thank you. [President Barbie] All right. Madam President. Oh. Please, may the Kens have one Supreme Court Justice? Oh, I can’t do that. But maybe a lower circuit court judgeship. We accept. As long as we can wear robes. [narrator] Well, the Kens have to start somewhere. And one day, the Kens will have as much power and influence in Barbie Land as women have in the Real World. No, I don’t want to. Just go! I can’t. Grow up and go. I have an idea. Tell me your secret dream, child. Okay, what about Ordinary Barbie? She’s not extraordinary. She’s not president of anything, or maybe she is. Maybe she’s a mom. Maybe she’s not. Because it’s okay to just want to be a mom, or to wanna be president or a mom who is president. Or not a mom who’s also not president. She just has a flattering top, and she wants to get through the day feeling kinda good about herself. That’s a terrible idea. Yeah, that’s going to make money. Oh. Ordinary Barbie. I love it. Fantastic. Okay, great. Great. Cool. Yes. We good? I think we’re good, right? All right, let’s begin the work to close the portal between our two worlds. Hey, what about Barbie? What do you mean? [crowd] Yeah, what about Barbie? What’s her ending? What does she get? Well, that’s easy. She’s in love with Ken. [crowd] Aw. That is not her ending. [groans in frustration] I’m not in love with Ken. [crowd] Oh. What do you want? I don’t know. I’m… I’m not really sure where I belong anymore. I don’t think I have an ending. [Ruth] That was always the point. I created you so you wouldn’t have an ending. It’s you. You’re Ruth from Mattel. Baby, I am Mattel. Until the IRS got to me, but that’s another movie. So, you’re… Ruth Handler. Inventor of Barbie. [crowd gasps] What? That’s so cool. Her ghost keeps an office on the 17th floor. [Ruth] What? What? [Ruth] You guys, you think the lady who invented Barbie looks like Barbie? [laughing] I’m a five-foot-nothing grandma with a double mastectomy… and tax evasion issues. [laughing] Nobody looks like Barbie, except, of course, Barbie. Take a bow, honey. I don’t really feel like Barbie anymore. Come, walk with me. [solemn music playing] Thank you. Thank you, Barbie. Thank you. I’m not really sure what I’m supposed to do now. I’ve always been Stereotypical Barbie, and I don’t think I’m really good at anything else. You saved Barbie Land from patriarchy. That was very much a group effort. And you helped that mother and daughter connect. They really helped each other. Maybe you’re Self-Effacing Barbie? Maybe I’m not Barbie anymore. You understand that humans only have one ending. Ideas live forever, humans not so much. You know that, right? I do. Being a human can be pretty uncomfortable. I know. Humans make things up like patriarchy and Barbie just to deal with how uncomfortable it is. I understand that. And then you die. [chuckles softly] Yeah. Yeah. I want to be a part of the people that make meaning. Not the thing that’s made. I want to do the imagining. I don’t wanna be the idea. Does that make sense? I always knew that Barbie would surprise me, but I never expected this. Do you give me permission to become human? You don’t need my permission. But you’re the creator. You… Don’t you control me? [Ruth] I can’t control you any more than I can control my own daughter. I named you after her, Barbara. And I always hoped for you like I hoped for her. We mothers stand still so our daughters can look back to see how far they’ve come. So, being human’s not something I need to… ask for or even want? I can just… It’s something that I just discover I am? I can’t in good conscience let you take this leap without you knowing what it means. Take my hands. Now close your eyes.

              "'Stereotypical\\xa0Barbie (“Barbie”) and fellow dolls reside in Barbieland; a\\xa0matriarchal\\xa0society with different variations of Barbies, Kens, and a group of discontinued models, who are treated like outcasts due to their unconventional traits. While the Kens spend their days playing at the beach, considering it as their profession, the Barbies hold prestigious jobs such as doctors, lawyers, and politicians. Beach Ken (“Ken”) is only happy when he is with Barbie and seeks a closer relationship, but Barbie rebuffs him in favor of other activities and female friendships. * * * [narrator] Since the beginning of time, since the first little girl ever existed, there have been dolls. But the dolls were always and forever baby dolls. The girls who played with them could only ever play at being mothers. Which can be fun, at least for a while, anyway. Ask your mother. This continued until… [“Thus Spoke Zarathustra” plays] [warning buzz] [ting] [narrator] Yes, Barbie changed everything. Then, she changed it all again. All of these women are Barbie, and Barbie is all of these women. She might have started out as just a lady in a bathing suit, but she became so much more. She has her own money, her own house, her own car, her own career. Because Barbie can be anything, women can be anything. And this has been reflected back onto the little girls of today in the Real World. Girls can grow into women, who can achieve everything and anything they set their mind to. Thanks to Barbie, all problems of feminism and equal rights have been solved. At least that’s what the Barbies think. After all, they’re living in Barbie Land. Who am I to burst their bubble? And here is one of those Barbies now, living her best day every day.

I’ll beach off with you any day, Ken. Hold my ice cream, Ken. All right, Ken, you’re on. Let’s beach off. Anyone who wants to beach him off has to beach me off first. I will beach both of you off at the same time. But you don’t even know how to beach yourself off. How you gonna beach both of us off? [Barbie] Uh, Kens? It doesn’t make sense. Why are you getting emotional? So you can beach yourself off! Come on, Kens. Nobody’s gonna beach anyone off. Okay? Let’s go. [exhales] Okay, okay. Okay. You did so well. You still hurt? We’ll get you fixed up. Go! Go! Barbie, hold my hand! You’re okay. Stay with me, Barbie! [shutter flashes] Great. Not even broken. You’ll be fine.

Let’s run towards the water. Okay. [gasps] Oh. [grunting] [gasping] [gasps] Oh! My feet! [sighs] [gasps] Oh, no. [panting] Yes! So good! [grunting] Hey, Barbie. Hi. Are you okay? Hey, Barbie. Yeah, Barbie. I just fell. Fell? I’m so embarrassed. Barbie doesn’t get embarrassed. I know. Barbie, I don’t even have context for this, but my feet… my heels are on the ground. I’m no longer on tiptoes. That’s okay. Let me see. [all gasp] [screams] Flat feet! [retches] [all screaming] [retching] [sobbing] Oh, no! [retching] Stop it, Ken. I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I know I’m Stereotypical Barbie and therefore don’t form conjectures concerning the causality of adjacent unfolding events, but some things have been happening that might be related. [sighs] Bad breath this morning, a cold shower, burnt waffle, and falling off my roof. [gasps] You’re malfunctioning. What? No, I’m just, I’m… Am I? I’ve never seen this kind of malfunction before. It’s usually just hair-related. You know, you’re gonna have to visit Weird Barbie. I have never had to visit Weird Barbie. That’s because you’ve never malfunctioned. I heard that she used to be the most beautiful Barbie of all, but then someone played with her too hard in the Real World. [“Spice Up Your Life” playing] ♪ Colors of the world ♪ ♪ Spice up your life ♪ ♪ Every boy and every girl ♪ ♪ Spice up your life ♪ ♪ People of the world ♪ ♪ Spice up your life ♪ ♪ Ahh ♪ ♪ Slam me to the left ♪ ♪ If you’re having a good time ♪ ♪ Shake it to the right ♪ And now she’s fated to an eternity of making other Barbies perfect while falling more and more into disrepair herself. That, and we all call her Weird Barbie both behind her back and also to her face. She’s so weird. Why is she always in the splits? [thunder rumbling] [grunts] I would never wear heels if my feet were shaped this way. Hello? Woof. [gasps] Oh. [plops] Bark. [plops] Woof. Bark. Hey. What’s cookin’, good-lookin’? Hi. Welcome. Welcome to my Weirdhouse. [grunts] Hi, how are ya? Nice to meet you. Sorry about the dog crap. What can I do ya for? I just had to come see you about my feet. They’re, um… Flat. Yeah. Never seen that before. Really? Whoa. Okay. Well, can you, you know, fix them? You’re Stereotypical Barbie, right? Mmm-hmm. [chuckles] That Ken of yours, he is one nice-looking little protein pot. I guess. I’d like to see what kind of nude blob he’s packing under those jeans. [sighs] Anyway, what preceded this? Oh, nothing. A really fun game of volleyball. That’s it? Thoughts of death. What is it? [stammers] Maybe some thoughts of death? Thoughts of death! Is that a problem? Oh. What? I’ve heard of this. Of course, I didn’t think it was possible, but it’s real. Oh, you’ve done it. You’ve opened a portal. I didn’t open a portal. [chuckles] Someone did. And now, there is a rip in the continuum that is the membrane between Barbie Land and the Real World, and if you wanna be Stereotypical Barbie perfect again, then, baby girl, you gotta go fix it. Or you’re gonna keep going funny. Look at your upper thigh. [gasps] What is that? That’s cellulite. That’s gonna spread everywhere. What? And then you’re gonna start getting sad and mushy and complicated. No! [hisses] What do I have to do? You have to go to the Real World. Okay. And you have to find the girl who’s playing with you. Playing with me? We’re all being played with, babe. But usually there’s some kind of separation. Thanks. There’s the girl and the doll. And never the twain shall cross. The twain is crossing? Yes. And the girl who’s playing with you, she must be sad, and her thoughts and feelings and humanness are interfering with your dollness. Why would she be sad? We fixed everything so that all women in the Real World can be happy and powerful. I don’t know, but if you ask me, you had something to do with this, too. Me? Takes two to rip a portal. I can’t have. I’ve only ever wanted for everything to stay exactly as it is. Well, be that as it may, the two of you are becoming inextricably intertwined. And you gotta help her to help yourself. [girls’ voices echoing faintly] So, should… Whoo! So, what’ll it be then? You can go back to your regular life and forget any of this ever happened, or you can know the truth about the universe. The choice is now yours. The first one. The high heel. No. We’ll do a re-do. You’re supposed to want to know. I don’t. Mmm. Babe, listen. You have to want to know, okay? Do it again. I’m not Adventure Barbie. I’m Stereotypical Barbie. I’m like the Barbie you think of when someone says, “Think of a Barbie.” That’s me. I’m bummed. You’re a bummer. That’s a bummer. Okay, I’m ready to forget now. No! You’re doing this one! I just gave you a choice so you could feel some sense of control. So there is no option one? No! You have to fix the rip yourself. Don’t blame me, blame Mattel. They make the rules. [whining] Oh, I don’t want to. Fine, get cellulite. I don’t care. No! No, no, no. No. Okay. Yeah. [sighs] Send me through the portal. Okay. There’s actually no portal. Oh. It’s a figure of speech. It’s actually a sports car to a speedboat, to a rocket ship, to a tandem bike, to a camper van, fun, to a snowmobile, brr, which will take you most of the way to the state of Los Angeles, where you will don neon and Rollerblades, and enter the country of California. Weird, I know. Best if you don’t think about it too much. And then when I get there, how do I find this girl? You will know. Okay. And how do I get back? The same way you came, but in reverse. Like I should move forward but do the order backward or go… Don’t overthink it. Oh. Okay. For you see, if you do not find her and fix things, what’s ugly will become uglier, and what’s weird will become weirder. And then you’ll look like me. Ahh! Oh. Sorry. I understand. I set myself up for that. Anyway, I believe in you. Thank you. Go. Be careful. I love you. Bye. Bye. [crowd] Bon voyage to reality, and good luck restoring the membrane that separates our world from theirs so you don’t get cellulite! [cheering] I guess she’s going without you. You’re so lost, Ken. [laughs] She literally asked me. And I was like, “I prefer to stay here.” Why? Are you scared? No. [laughs] I bet you’re scared. And I bet she doesn’t even want you to go. Well, you bet both those things incorrectly, and I bet in the opposite direction. Yeah? Yeah. Which way is that? You don’t even know. I just don’t want to leave. I’m trying to find reasons not to leave. Please stay. I’m gonna miss you guys so much. I just wish someone could come with me, but you can’t. I should do this alone. What bird am I thinking of? Parrot. Dolphin. I mean, no, a bird. Pelican. Ohh. Man. We’ll miss you, Barbie. [Stereotypical Barbie] I’ll be back in no time, with perfect feet, and we’ll forget that this ever happened. And you’ll get to see all the good work we’ve done to fix the world. You’ll be such a hero to them. All those grateful, powerful women who owe their wonderful lives to Barbie. I’ll bet every woman will say thank you and give you a really big hug. [giggles] Yes, you’re right. Here I go. Bye. Yay! Bye, Barbie. Bye. [whooshes] [“Closer to Fine” playing] Bye, Barbie.

Barbie, what if there’s beach? You’ll need someone who’s a professional in that. Did you bring your Rollerblades? I literally go nowhere without them. Please? Okay. Wow. [chuckling] Let’s do this. Can I sit in the front? No. [narrator] And so Barbie and Ken set off on their adventure to the Real World.

Ooh, love that! Wow! I feel kind of ill at ease. Like… I don’t know the word for it, but I’m… [man 1] Nice leotard. Conscious, but it’s myself that I’m conscious of. [Ken] I’m not getting any of that. I feel what could only be described as admired. [man 2] Damn, girl! But not ogled. [man 3] You’re hot. And there’s no undertone of violence. Mine very much has an undertone of violence. Oh, look, a construction site. We need that good feminine energy. Yeah. Ladies! Yoo-hoo. Oh. You got fries with that shake? If I said you had a hot body, would you hold it against me? [man 4] Have I died and gone to heaven? [man 5] Is that a mirror in your pocket? Baby, you are an angel. I can see myself in your shorts. I don’t know exactly what you meant with all of those little quips, but I’m picking up on some sort of entendre, which appears to be double, and I would just like to inform you, I do not have a vagina. And he does not have a penis. We don’t have genitals. That’s okay. Yeah. Yeah, whatever. Yeah. It’s cool. I have all the genitals. Geez, you would think a construction site at lunch time would be the perfect place for a little woman power, but this one was so… male. Everything is almost like… reversed here. [seagulls cawing] Oh, look! The Supreme Court. [Ken] They’re so smart. Yeah. [man 6] Yeah, bruh! Do it, bro! [slap lands] [“Chose Your Fighter” playing] [gasps] [camera shutter clicks] [camera shutter clicks] I love me a leotard. I love the elbow pads. I think we should get some different clothes. [waves crashing] [seagulls cawing] We look great. I love fringe. I love denim. Ha-ha-ha-ha! [laughs] Hey, man. You guys gotta pay for that stuff. [cop] She looks even better in more clothes. Because you can imagine more. You know what? Keep ’em. Weird Barbie said I would know how to find this girl, but I have no idea. Hmm. What would a smart Barbie do? I just need to clear my mind so I can think. Who is playing with me? I hate it when people think. I get so bored. Faster I figure it out, the faster we get to go home. What am I supposed to do? Ken! Go for a walk or something. By myself? Yes. Really? Where? Anywhere. Can I go that way? Yes. Okay. Don’t go far. Okay! [exhales] [man] Excuse me, sir. Thanks, man. [“Also Sprach Zarathustra” funk remix playing] [man] What’s up, man? We’ve got to man up on this one. Great workout, man. [both in unison] Men, men, men. You’re the man! No, you’re the man!

[chuckles] Barbie! Barbie! Yes! [both] I’ve got it! Oh, what do you got? You go first. No, no, you go. We’ll go at the same time. Okay. She’s at school. Men rule the world! What was that? The kid’s at the school? But what did you say? Nothing. Okay. Well, let’s go to the school. Okay! Now, come on. [phone rings] Hello. This is Dan of the FBI. Oh. This is Aaron at Mattel. I don’t give a flying squirrel who you are, Aaron. What are you, like an intern? No, I’m… Two of your dolls have gotten loose. Impossible. How do you know? Don’t sass me, Aaron. Couple of blondes, answering to Barbie and Ken. Rollerblading in Santa Monica. We’re gonna need Mattel’s help landing the eagle. Don’t crap the bed, Aaron! I won’t. [line disconnects] This is bad. This is really bad. What? [stammering] This happened before. What? When? I heard about ten years ago, a woman named Skipper turned up at some family’s home in Key West. Asked to babysit the kids. She then tried to take their toddler surfing. Geez. I know. They were able to straighten it out, keep it under wraps, but this is serious. I’m going all the way up. No one goes all the way up. I have to. You may never come back. I know. [humming] ♪ Closer I am to fine [humming] Oh. Hey. Oh, hi, Aaron. New drawings? Yeah. I just started drawing these weird designs.

We sell dreams. [Sasha’s mom whispering] Aaron. And imagination! And sparkle! I get excited. I’m passionate. And when you think of sparkle, what do you think of after that? Female agency. Excuse me. Who are you? Aaron Dinkins, sir. We’re in the middle of a major sit-down here, Aaron Dinkins. I think you’re gonna want to hear this, sir. Can you just e-mail it? And you can send it to me EOD. [whispering] End of day. [chuckles] That’s cool. Yeah. [stammers] May I put it in a whisper, sir? Fine. Whisper me. [whispers] [drumsticks tapping] [all whispering] [chuckles] [whispering] No. No! Ahh! Ahh! No. [man 1] Get the chair! [man 2] Take the cart. [man 3] They’re okay. You all right? He’s okay. Okay. He’s okay. [exhales] It’s a repeat of Skipper in Key West. And with all due respect, that was Skipper, sir. This is… Barbie. [sighs] If this got out that our dolls were coming to Los Angeles from Barbie Land as life-size versions of themselves… [panting] roaming the earth… this would be very bad. Barbie in the Real World? That’s impossible. We’ve got a definite situation on our hands. Catastrophic! I can’t stress that enough! What? What’s your name again? Aaron Dinkins, sir. Aaron Dickinson? Dinkins. Yes! Aaron. Is Barbie Land like an alternate reality or is it like a place where your imagination… [all] Yes! Okay. Think of it as a town in Sweden, Aaron Dinkins. [all] Sweden. Right. [sighs] How much do you weigh? It doesn’t matter. [clears throat] Sounds like a job for the box. No one rests until this doll is back in a box. [school bell rings] [Barbie] Look, Davy Crockett Junior High School, just like I saw in my vision. [Ken] A man on a horse. I’ve started to get all these weirdo feelings. Like, I have fear with no specific object. What is that? It’s anxiety. I have it too. They’re just awful at this age. I feel amazing. [chuckles] That’s because kids don’t take it out on the dads. [Barbie] She’s gotta be here somewhere. I need to find her soon. I’m just gonna pop into the library and see if I can find any books on trucks. [chuckles] Okay, just don’t get in trouble. I won’t!

Everyone really likes me and thinks I’m cool and pretty. Huh. Thank you. Hey, ladies. Sasha, what’s up? [exclaims] Who are you? [laughs] I’m only your favorite woman of all time. Barbie! [laughs] You really think you’re Barbie? Yeah. She’s crazy. Do you think she escaped from like an insane asylum? So you’re like “Barbie” Barbie? Like a professional bimbo? No. Barbie’s not a bimbo. Barbie is a doctor and a lawyer and a senator and a Nobel Prize winner. You’re a Nobel Prize winner? Oh. No, not me, but Barbie is. Yeah. Aren’t you guys gonna thank me and give me a big hug? [laughs] For being your favorite toy? We haven’t played with Barbie since we were like five years old. Yeah, I hated dolls with hair. I mean, I’d play with Barbie, but it was, like, the last resort. I loved Barbie. [clears throat] Oh. Anyways, even then, it was horrible for us. It was horrible? Why? Come on, Sasha. Give it to her. Destroy Barbie. [sighs] Okay, Barbie, let’s do this. You’ve been making women feel bad about themselves since you were invented. I think you have that the wrong way around. You represent everything wrong with our culture. Sexualized capitalism, unrealistic physical ideals… No, no, no. You’re describing something stereotypical. Barbie is so much more than that. Look at yourself. Well, I am technically Stereotypical Barbie. You set the feminist movement back 50 years. You destroy girls’ innate sense of worth and you are killing the planet with your glorification of rampant consumerism. No, I’m supposed to help you and make you happy and powerful. Oh, I am powerful. And until you showed up here and declared yourself Barbie, I hadn’t thought about you in years, you fascist! Oh. Um… Okay. It’s happening again. [laughing] I have to… Will you excuse me? It was really nice talking to you. They never listen. Excuse me, sir, do you have the time? You respect me. Sorry, no, do you know what time it is? No, I do not. [laughs] Okay. Why didn’t Barbie tell me about patriarchy, which, to my understanding, is where men and horses run everything? Sure. I shall seek my fortune there. All right. So… I’ll take a high-level, high-paying job with influence, please. Okay, you’ll need at least an MBA. And a lot of our people have PhDs. Isn’t being a man enough? Actually, right now, it’s kind of the opposite. You guys are clearly not doing patriarchy very well. [laughing] No! No. We’re, uh… We’re doing it well, yeah. We just… hide it better now. Oh. No, I won’t let you do just one appendectomy. But I’m a man. But not a doctor. Please? No. Can I talk to a doctor? You are talking to a doctor. Can you get me a coffee? No. And I need a clicky pen. No. And a white coat. No. And a sharp thing. No. There he is. Doctor! Somebody get security. I’d like to apply for your job of beach. So, you want to be a lifeguard? Oh. I’m not trained to go over there. I’m trained to stand confidently right here. There’s nobody in danger here. And even if there were, I’m not trained to save them. [chuckles] Then I can’t hire you. I can’t even beach here! [sobbing] She thinks I’m a fascist? I don’t control the railways or the flow of commerce. [sobs] There you are. Oh, no. That went terrible. I need to find somewhere where I can start patriarchy fresh. Miss Barbie? [sniffling] It’s just Barbie. We’re gonna need you to come with us. Oh. Who are you? We’re Mattel. Mattel? Mattel. Oh, thank goodness! I’ve gotta talk to somebody in charge. Everything is backwards here. Men look at me like I’m an object. Girls hate me. Everyone thinks I’m crazy, and I keep getting arrested. Need you to step this way, ma’am. I also just learned to cry. First, I got one tear and then I got a whole bunch. What do I do? Do I follow Barbie into that scary unmarked black truck car? A truck car I’d like to have, actually. You’re right, she’s fine. It’s Mattel. [chuckles] Yeah. I know. I’ll go back to Barbie Land, and I’ll tell the Kens what I’ve learned. Oh, it’s going to be beautiful! [chuckles] Okay. Back to Barbie Land. Let’s go that way. Hi, Bunny Boo-Boo. Don’t call me that. Sorry. I’m off early because of a crisis at work, but I thought we could go get some soft serve. Thank God they arrested that nutjob. Um, um… that reality-challenged woman. She thinks she’s Barbie. Wait, what did you say? She thinks she’s Barbie. She’s, like, fully convinced. [gasps] What are you doing? What are you doing? Mom. Mom! Mom, get back in the car! Are you kidding me? Mom! Mattel! Of course it was you guys that brought me here. Because it definitely wasn’t that Sasha girl. Thanks for the ride. This has been so much fun. [gasps] Wow, the mothership! [door hisses] [gasping] Barbie! We’re so happy to see you. Hi! [man] Would you like some mineral water? Yes, thank you. Oh, thanks. I’m not used to that having anything in it. [men laughing] [Barbie] Thank you. So, we’ve been very anxious to get some quality face-time with you. Of course. So what can I do to repair the rift in the space-time continuum, get my feet back, and that one cellulite gone, and just generally not turn into Weird Barbie? We have been discussing that very topic. If you’re agreeable to it, we would love it if you could just get into that giant box. Get into the box and you’ll go back to Barbie Land. And everything will be as it was. You know what? We should probably get Ken first. Ken? [confused chatter] Ken. You know, Ken. Barbie and Ken. [chuckles] Oh! Yes, Ken. Yeah. Ken. The guy. Yeah. [panting] Back to Barbie Land! [laughs] I’m gonna be sick. I’m gonna be sick. [retches] Ken isn’t something we’re worried about. Ever. Okay, I’ll just, um… I’ll get in the box then. All right! Yes! [applauding] Oh. But since I came all this way, could I just meet the woman in charge, your CEO? Oh, that would be me. Oh. Your CFO. Me. Your COO. Here. President of the Barbie division. Present. I’m a man with no power. Does that make me a woman? Are any women in charge? Listen, I know exactly where you’re going with this, and I have to say I really resent it. We are a company literally made of women. We had a woman CEO in the ’90s. And there was another one… at some other time. So that’s… That’s two right there. Women are the freaking foundation of this very long phallic building. We have gender-neutral bathrooms up the wazoo. Every single one of these men love women. I’m the son of a mother. I’m the mother of a son. I’m… I’m the nephew of a woman aunt. Some of my best friends are Jewish. What I’m trying to say is… Get in the box, you Jezebel! [men exclaiming] What? I can’t say Jezebel now? I haven’t been in a box in ages. See? It’s easy. Oh, okay. Huh. Oh, my gosh. I remember this smell. [gasps] I’m having a real Proustian flashback. Remember Proust Barbie? That did not sell very well. [chuckles] [twist ties creaking] Oh! Ha-ha! You know what? Um, before I get in the box, could I just run to the restroom and make sure my hair is perfect? Fine. Can you be speedy about it? Mmm-hmm. [door whirring] Down this way? It’s just down the hallway. Thank you. [Mattel CEO] On the right.

It’s because I don’t know how to drink tea? [chuckles] No. You look different. Oh. It’s not how I normally look. I usually look perfect. Oh, I don’t know. I think you’re just right. [chuckles] Real World isn’t what I thought it was. It never is. And isn’t that marvelous? Who are you? [Mattel CEO] Which way did she go? Who saw her last? Uh, if you go through that closet, you’ll find a stairwell down to the lobby. [Mattel CEO] Find her! Okay. Thank you, um… Ruth. Ruth. Thank you, Ruth. You’re welcome, Barbie.

[Sasha’s mom grunts] Okay. [system beeps] Oh, no! Now we’re never gonna get Barbie! [system chimes] Oh, we didn’t need it! Barbie! [engine revving] Let’s form a plan here. I would normally have shotgun. I’ll go in the first one. [Sasha’s mom] Hang on. [tires screeching] Ahh! God, I hope nobody from school saw us put a life-size Barbie in our car. [Sasha] How did this even happen? [Sasha’s mom] I don’t know. How are you here? You’re like an idea. A great idea. So, I’ve been a little lonely lately. And I found those Barbies we used to play with… I thought we gave those away. Well, I started playing with them. And making drawings like we used to do. Remember? Because I thought it would be joyful. Was it? No, it wasn’t. I got sad and weird, and then the drawings got sad and weird, and maybe because I couldn’t be like you, I ended up making you like me. Did any of these drawings by chance have thoughts of death and cellulite? Yes! Irrepressible Thoughts of Death Barbie. Oh, my God! And Cellulite! [both gasping] I came for you! You came for me! Those were your memories. [soft dreamy music playing] [inaudible] [Sasha’s voice echoes] Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Are you two, like, shining? No! No, it’s nothing like that. Are you shining with a real Barbie? No! I mean, maybe. Like a little, yes. [sighs] I don’t even know where to start with this wishing-a-Barbie-to-life crap. Oh, Sasha, listen. I’m just a boring mom with a boring job and a daughter who hates me. Can you blame me for wanting to have a little fun? [engines revving] I gotta lose these chuckleheads. [chimes] [engine revving] [Barbie] Ahh! [Sasha] Mom! [upbeat rock music playing] I think I owe you ladies an apology. I thought that Barbie had made the Real World better, but the Real World is forever and irrevocably messed up! Well, the Real World is not perfect, but you inspired me. I love women. I want to help women. Oh, come off it, everybody hates women. Women hate women, and men hate women. It’s the one thing we can all agree on. Is that true? It’s complicated. Hate is a strong word. Wake up, Mom! [brakes screech] I am wide awake, Sasha! [gasps] Mom, where did you learn to drive like this? There was this guy. Was it Dad? Yeah, yeah, it was… It was Dad. [engines revving] [tires screech] [Sasha’s mom whispers] Okay, duck. [whispering] You look so pretty. Don’t look at me. Okay, sorry. [gasps] [sighs] I can’t hold them off forever. Where can we go? [gasps] Wait, I have an idea. Can you get us to Venice Beach? Sure can. Ah! I love Rollerblades. Where are we going? Barbie Land. [Sasha] What? Mom! Are you really gonna let Barbie take you and your tween daughter to an imaginary land? Yes, and you wanna know why? Because I never get to do anything. I didn’t even go on that cruise I won at your school raffle because I didn’t have enough vacation days and your dad’s allergic to sun. Oh. What about Dad? We can’t just leave him! He’ll be fine. Bolígrafos. [voice on app] Bolígrafos. Bolígrafos. [correct answer chimes] Yeah, yeah. He’ll be fine. Ready for fun? Yes! Great! Here we go! Come on and feel the magic. [“Journey To The Real World” instrumental playing] [Sasha’s mom gasps] Where are we? How did we get into these clothes? How did we get into this vehicle? When I was a kid, I lost these boots and my mom wouldn’t let me buy a whole new Barbie just to replace the boots. They look so good on you. Why, thank you. Hey, you! She was always my favorite Barbie. You’re my favorite human. Don’t tell him, but I never got a Ken. That’s because Ken is totally superfluous. [Sasha’s mom laughing] [gasps] I didn’t say that. Women hold all major positions of power, control all the money. Basically, everything that men do in your world, women do in ours. [Sasha’s mom gasps] I mean, that sounds kind of cool. Sasha, look, dolphins! [all chuckling] [“Closer to Fine” playing] ♪ Closer I am to fine ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ Closer I am to fine ♪ [yells] What is this song? Oh, and we have a female president and it’s fun and work and friendship and female 24/7. [Sasha] Do giant hands come in and play with you? [Barbie] No, that’s crazy. Excuse me. Have you seen a group of women on wheels? Actually, yeah, there was a blonde, a brunette and a tween. They Rollerbladed in that direction. Oh, no. First step is always Rollerblading. [Aaron] Excuse me, sir? They’ve gone to Barbie Land. Oh, no. And she’s brought humans there with her. This could mean extremely weird things for our world. Like what? Nothing any of our collective imaginations could ever dream up. A podcast hosted by two wise trees. Or a choir of 2,000 young fathers. Not even close. We’ve got to get to Barbie Land. Go! Find some blades now! Just pick a direction and run! I can practically feel my heels lifting already. Yes! This is what I was supposed to do. Bring you back here. It feels right. It does. Okay, this is… Oh. That’s strange. [cheerleaders cheering] [shouting and cheering] [“Man I Am” playing] ♪ ‘Cause that’s the man I am ♪ ♪ Baby, treat me right ♪ Incoming brewski beer. [mimics airplane] So, that’s our president, with the beer. And the cheering squad is the Supreme Court. This is so much better than being president. Something’s weird today. [water bubbling] Hi, Barbie! Oh, okay. Hi, Ken. Have a brewski beer. My big guy is thirsty. Ah. Anyway, uh… Wait until you see my Dreamhouse. Everything I’ve bought and own will totally inspire you. And we can change clothes again! That’s the Capitol. [Sasha’s mom] Ah! It’s pink? Pink! And that’s the… [horse neighing] [Sam Smith] ♪ You think That women rule the world ♪ [Barbie] These are the Dreamhouses. This is where I live. [Sasha’s mom] You can see through the houses. So does each Barbie, like, have their own house? Mmm-hmm. That’s cool. Where do the Kens stay? I don’t know. At first I thought the Real World was run by men. And then there was a minute where I thought it was run by horses. But then I realized that horses are just men extenders. [Kens] Oh! [Pompadour Ken] Hmm? Oh. I had that treehouse. I saved up my allowance to buy it. [Barbie] I’ve never seen a car like that before. What happened here? Everything, basically everything exists to expand and elevate the presence of men. That’s amazing. That’s beautiful. I know. [other Ken 1] Barbie’s here. [other Ken 2] Uh-oh. Ken? [laughs nervously] What have you done? What are you wearing? Don’t question it. Just roll with it, tiny baby. [other Ken] Tiny baby. Don’t call me baby. What about mini-baby? Like this mini-fridge. [Kens laugh] No, Ken. This is my Dreamhouse. It is my Dreamhouse! It’s mine! No, this is no longer Barbie’s Dreamhouse. This shall henceforth be known as Ken’s Mojo Dojo Casa House. You don’t have to say dojo and house. And casa… But you do because it feels good. Try it. [both] Mojo Dojo Casa… No, girls. Don’t say it. Mojo Dojo Casa House. [laughs] [Mattel CEO] Give it to me straight. How weird is it? Whoa, boss, these Mojo Dojo Casa Houses are literally flying off the shelves. The kids are clamoring for them. Ken is on T-shirts, mugs. It’s the number one tattoo. [Mattel CEO] Oh, no. Warner Bros. have started auditions for the Ken movie, which is already a blockbuster hit. [laughs] It’s happening. That thing we could never imagine. If we don’t get my words lady… Executive Assistant. My Executive Words Lady and someone who’s probably her daughter back here and close the portal, our worlds could be altered forever. Well, what does it matter if it’s Barbie or Ken? The money is pouring in. Shame on you, Executive Number Two. You think I spent my entire life in boardrooms because of a bottom line? No! I got into this business because of little girls and their dreams. In the least creepy way possible. Now, blade faster. Time is running out. Look, I’m just having some brewski beers at my Mojo Dojo Casa House. [all gasp] Ken! You can stay if you want, as my bride wife, or my long-term-lowcommitment-distance girlfriend. What do you say? Ugh. Brewski beer me? I will not brewski beer you. Ha-ha-ha. That’s fine. You know, now that you Barbies aren’t around to run everything, we can do our hair however we like. I have hats. Where are my hungry boys? Who wants snacks? Barbie, I am so happy to see you. Can you believe what is happening? I know. Isn’t it great? Anyone need a brewski beer? What are you doing? You’re a doctor. I like being a helpful decoration. And Allan likes to help me give all the Kens foot massages. No, I don’t, I don’t like that. [both] We love it. Ugh, so gross. I’m so blotto-faced day-drunk right now. [laughs] Ditto same-same that. [Brunette Barbie 2] I like not having to make any decisions. It’s like a spa day for my brain. Forever. What is wrong with them? We just explained to them the immaculate, impeccable seamless garment of logic that is patriarchy, and they crumbled. Oh, my God. This is like in the 1500s with the indigenous people and smallpox. They had no defenses against it. Yeah. Buckle up, babe. [chuckles] Because Barbie Land is now Ken Land. And it’s gonna be just like Century City in Los Angeles, because they had it all figured out in Century City. The minute you get out of your car, you’re like, “I can’t believe how great this place is!” No, no, no. They don’t have it figured out in Century City because we failed them. [loudly] No! You failed me! [sighs] [melancholy music playing] [breath trembles] Out there, I was somebody. And when I walked down the street… people respected me just for who I am. [scoffs] One lady, she even asked me for the time. No way! Way. [chuckles] And if it weren’t for these technicalities like MBAs, medical degrees, and I don’t know, swim lessons, I could have ruled that world. But I don’t need any of those things here. [chuckles lightly] [car bonnet squeaking] Here, I’m just a dude. And you know what? That’s enough. TV remote. Which one is it? Oh, it’s that one right there. [Reporter Barbie laughs] [TV Ken] Call me Mister Ken President Prime Minister, ma’am. Let’s recap all the amazing changes and innovations thanks to the Kens. The Nobel Prize in horses goes to… [audience Ken] Ken! [applause] [audience chanting] Ken! Ken! Ken! Ken! Ken! [gasps] [Reporter Barbie] Wow. And now you’re making it permanent with a special election to change the Constitution. That’s right. In just 48 hours, all the Kens will head to the polls and vote to change the Constitution to a government for the Kens, of the Kens, and by the Kens! [cymbals crash] [upbeat music playing on keyboard] You can’t do this. This is Barbie Land. The Barbies worked hard and they dreamed hard to make it everything that it is. You… You can’t just undo it in a day. Literally and figuratively, watch me. Now, if you’ll excuse me… this is my Mojo Dojo Casa House, it’s not Barbie’s Mojo Dojo Casa House. Right? [gasps] [somber music playing] How’s that feel? It is not fun, is it? [Barbies and Kens] It’s boys’ night! [all cheering] Every night is boys’ night. [Kens chanting] Go, Ken! Go, Ken! Go, Ken! [Kens cheering] [crying] Barbie! Take your lady fashions with you. Take your Celebrate Disco Bell Bottoms… [ding] [Barbie] Oh! [Ken] …and your Ice Capades Pretty Practice Suit and Dazzling Show Skirt. [gasps] These are archival. Your Pajama Jam in Amsterdam sets. [Barbie] No! And your Pretty Paisley Palazzo Pants! Not the Palazzos! And get out! [crying] [Sasha’s mom] Maybe this could fit me. Honey. Why did you wish me to your messed-up world using your complicated human thoughts and feelings? What? Barbie Land was perfect before. I was perfect before. I’m so sorry. I wasn’t trying to do anything. [objects clattering] Don’t apologize. Don’t blame my mom. [Sasha’s mom] Aw, Sasha, that’s sweet. Maybe you wished us. Maybe it’s your fault, Barbie. [Barbie] No, I didn’t wish anything. I’ve never wanted anything to change. Oh, honey, that’s life. It’s all change. That’s… That’s terrifying. [somber music playing] I don’t want that. [music swelling] Not my life. No, thank you. Just, no, I don’t want this. [sighs] I’m just gonna sit here and wait and hope that one of the more leadership-oriented Barbies just snaps out of it and does something about this whole mess. I really understand this feeling. It’s basically, like, being a human person all the time… Please just leave me here. Just leave me. Go back to your messed-up world and just leave me to mine. So, you’re just gonna give up? [Barbie] Yes. [body squeaking] Okay. [Sasha] You know, I almost feel bad for you, but you are exactly what I thought you were. Um… Let’s go, honey. Let’s just… Okay, how do we… How do you expect… Do everything we did in reverse. Unbelievable. Come on, Mom. She doesn’t deserve you. [sighs] This is the lowest I’ve ever been. Emotionally and physically. [cheerful music playing] [girl] Okay, kids, it’s time to run out and get the new Depression Barbie. She wears sweatpants all day and night. She spent seven hours today on Instagram, looking at her estranged best friend’s engagement photos, while eating a family-size bag of Starbursts. And now her jaw is killing her. And she’s going to watch the BBC’s Pride and Prejudice for the seventh time until she falls asleep. Situation of our families is such that any alliance between us must be regarded as a highly reprehensible connection. [girl] Anxiety, panic attacks, and OCD sold separately. [Weird Barbie] Barbie. Barbie, wake up. Hey. [female voice] Weird. I’m like you now. Ugly and unwanted. Thanks. Let’s get her in the back. Come on. One, two… [tandem bike bell rings] Isn’t this great? [executives] Yes.

No, Allan. You can’t go. Having a Barbie in the Real World is what caused all these problems in the first place. Not one person would care if Allan was in the Real World.

Even if… Even if you can’t make it perfect, you can make it better. I can’t make anything better. I’m the one who ruined Barbie Land with my stupid drawings in the first place. They’re not stupid! They’re amazing! You like my drawings? They’re weird and dark and crazy. Everything you pretend not to be. I am, I am. I’m weird and I’m dark and I’m crazy. [groaning] Easy. Easy. Okay.

I already did everything I could. Oh, my God. I don’t even know how I got here. I don’t deserve this. Um, I’d like to thank Ken. -[Weird Barbie gags] -[Writer Barbie] Thank you, Ken. I love you, Ken. The fork in my soup is this, Barb. Why didn’t the brainwashing work on you? [Barbie] My exposure to the Real World must have made me immune. Either you’re brainwashed, or you’re weird and ugly. There is no in between. Sing it, sister. Well, get ready, kids. Because in 48 hours, Barbie Land becomes Ken Land. [door opens] [Allan] Come on, gang. We’ll find Barbie at the top of these stairs. The Kens. They’ve found us. [all clamoring] [body squeaking] [Writer Barbie] Ken! No! Get back. [Writer Barbie] Ken. Oh. Oh! [shushing] [Sasha’s mom] Hello? Hmm? Humans. We’re fine. [Barbies] Ah. And Allan. [Barbies] Hmm. Come into my Weirdhouse. Hi! I’m Weird Barbie. I’m in the splits, I have a funky haircut, and I smell like basement. Oh, my God. I had a Weird Barbie. Yeah, you did. You make them weird by playing too hard. That’s cool. [gasps] That’s Sugar Daddy Ken. And Earring Magic Ken. Mattel discontinued them. Sugar Daddy? No, no, no. I’m not a sugar daddy. This is Sugar, and I’m her daddy. And I have an earring. A magic earring. These were actual Kens. [gasps] More discontinued Barbies. Growing Up Skipper? May I? Okay. [Sasha’s mom] Watch this. [air hisses] Her boobs grow. Why would they do that? [Sasha’s mom] And Barbie Video Girl. I have a TV in my back. You know whose dream that is? Nobody. Nobody’s dream. And that’s Barbie Barbie, of course. She’s not dead. She’s just having an existential crisis. [Sasha’s mom] Okay, come on. Hey. What’s wrong? [crying] I’m not pretty anymore. What? You’re so pretty. I’m not Stereotypical Barbie pretty. [narrator] Note to the filmmakers. Margot Robbie is the wrong person to cast if you want to make this point. But you’re beautiful. It’s not just that. I’m not… smart enough to be interesting. You’re so smart. I can’t do brain surgery, I’ve never flown a plane. [Sasha’s mom scoffs] I’m not the president. No one on the Supreme Court is me. I’m not good enough for anything. [crying softly] It is literally impossible to be a woman. You are so beautiful and so smart, and it kills me that you don’t think you’re good enough. Like we have to always be extraordinary. But somehow, we’re always doing it wrong. [sighs] You have to be thin but not too thin, and you can never say you want to be thin. You have to say you want to be healthy, but also you have to be thin. You have to have money, but you can’t ask for money because that’s crass. [sighs] You have to be a boss but you can’t be mean. You have to lead, but you can’t squash other people’s ideas. You’re supposed to love being a mother, but don’t talk about your kids all the damn time. You have to be a career woman but also always be looking out for other people. You have to answer for men’s bad behavior, which is insane, but if you point that out, you’re accused of complaining. You’re supposed to stay pretty for men but not so pretty that you tempt them too much or that you threaten other women because you’re supposed to be a part of the sisterhood but always stand out. And always be grateful. But never forget that the system is rigged, so find a way to acknowledge that but also always be grateful. You have to never get old, never be rude, never show off, never be selfish, never fall down, never fail, never show fear, never get out of line. It’s too hard, it’s too contradictory, and nobody gives you a medal or says thank you. And it turns out, in fact, that not only are you doing everything wrong but also everything is your fault. [sighs] I’m just so tired of watching myself and every single other woman tie herself into knots so that people will like us. And if all of that is also true for a doll just representing a woman… then I don’t even know. Wait. I did write a book. It’s like I’ve been in a dream, where I was somehow really invested in the Zack Snyder cut of Justice League. But what you said broke me out of it. Really? Yeah. You’re back. She’s back. By giving voice to the cognitive dissonance required to be a woman under the patriarchy, you robbed it of its power. Yes. Wow, I just said all of that. Hell, yes, White Savior Barbie! No, it was your mom. Your mom did the saving. We have to stop the Kens. And you need to say all of those things to the other Barbies. That’s the key. Got it. But how are we gonna get the Barbies away from their Kens? We have experience with a world like this one. Do you have a map of Barbie Land? What do you think? [whirring] Wow. [Weird Barbie] Thanks. I built it. Okay, here’s the deal. It’s not just about how they see us, it’s about how they see themselves. Ken Land contains the seeds of its own destruction. First we have to get the Barbies away from their Kens. We could use a decoy Barbie who pretends to be brainwashed. That should be you. Cool. [rousing pop music playing] [Sasha] Distract them by appearing helpless and confused. Kens cannot resist a damsel in distress. [Sasha’s mom] You have to make them believe that you’re complacent. That they have the power. And when their guard is down, you take the power back. The influence that Porsche 356 has had on the motoring world as a whole, it can’t be overstated. Oh! Photoshop is so hard! I just don’t understand how to use the Select tool. Honey, you can only use the Select tool if the layer is highlighted. Let me show you. My tiny head is just swimming with technical jargon like color bands… Oh! Hi. And magnetic lassos and bit maps. Do you think that you and your strong arms can explain… Oh! What’s happening? [Barbie] Allan, go around! [President Barbie] Ahh! Oh, but what about Ken? No, no, no! No, but I love him! [Barbie] Come on, Allan! [President Barbie] Hey! What’s gonna happen to Ken? [Sasha’s mom] Just listen. You have to be their mommies but not remind them of their mommy. Any power you have must be masked under a giggle. [ding] What happened? One minute I was president, and the next I was cutting a Ken steak for him. Welcome back, Madam President. Then we’ll recruit the now unbrainwashed Barbies to our cause. [Barbie] They can be the new decoys. [Sasha’s mom] You can tell him that you’ve never seen The Godfather. And that you’d love them to explain it to you. Ooh, are you guys watching The Godfather? The Godfather. I’ve never seen it. Oh, my God. You’ve never seen The Godfather? This movie is a rich blend of Coppola‘s aesthetic genius and a triumph for Robert Evans and the architecture of the ’70s studio system. [President Barbie] Can you start the movie over and just talk through the whole thing? You have to find a way to reject men’s advances without damaging their egos. Because if you say yes to them, you’re a tramp, but if you say no to them, you’re a prude. [dings] I don’t wanna touch a foot. No, you don’t. Another one, be confused about money. I just have all my money in a savings account. That’s totally wrong. You need treasury bonds, corporate bonds, CDs. No one has CDs anymore. Oh, sweetheart, you are so cute when you’re confused. But no, not music. CD stands for Certificate of Deposit. Stephen Malkmus really harnessed the acerbic talk-singing of Lou Reed with post-punk influences such as Wire and The Fall. [dings] What am I wearing? I would never choose this. Because you’re a physicist. Do you want some pants? Yeah. [dinging] [gasps] Welcome back, Barbie. Gee, I am so awkward and don’t feel pretty at all, and will anyone ever like me? [Sasha] Or distract them with the old standby. Wearing glasses so they can discover that you’re pretty. May I? Sure. Go ahead. There. Now we can see your beautiful face. And then there’s pretending to be terrible at every sport ever. Here, let me show you. Here, let me show you. Here, let me show you. Here, let me show you. [Kens] Here, let us show you. We’ll do this until every single Barbie is deprogrammed and ready to take back Barbie Land. Yes! Yes! Yeah! [whistles] Hey! Tomorrow the Kens vote to change the Constitution, so we have to get there first. The final stage of our plan, to turn the Kens against each other. Now that they think they have power over you, you make them question whether they have enough power over each other. What if this doesn’t work? What if he doesn’t… like me anymore? He likes you. He was really upset. Because he likes you. And because he knows deep down that you don’t like him the same way. It still doesn’t mean I want to hurt him. He took your house. He brainwashed your friends. He wants to control the government. True. [Sasha’s mom] Girl. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. It’s like I’m a woman already. [Sasha’s mom] Welcome. Is this what it’s like? [groans] It’s time. I’m ready. Thank you. Here I go. [doorbell rings] Hi. [objects shuffling] [objects clattering] [Ken] Ahh! [objects clatter] Oh, hey. You’ve caught me reading. Oh. I’ve been thinking. Mm-hmm. [Barbie] Ken Land. Kendom. Kendom. Kendom Land. Land of the… Land of the free and the men. Right. Well, this place is… [Ken] Kendom Land. Really great. And the Kens really are just better at ruling than the Barbies ever were. Well, we just took patriarchy and you know, made a patriarchy. Yeah, well, I was thinking… Yes? I’m ready to be your long-term-distance low-commitment casual girlfriend, if you’ll still have me. Would you just hold on for one second? [Barbie] Oh, okay. [Ken, loudly] Sublime! I don’t know. I’m gonna have to think about that. [Barbie] Oh. Please? Okay. Come on in. I’ll play the guitar at you. Oh, yay!

No, against the Kens. But we are the Kens. The other Kens. We should probably call them something else so it doesn’t get confusing. No, because we’ll know what we mean. But when we’re on the battlefield and you say “Ken at four o’clock,” how will I know if you mean us Kens or the other Kens? Because, my dudes, we attack at ten o’clock and take advantage of the morning waves. But not so early ’cause we’re gonna want to sleep in. Right. But what will we fight with? We have no guns. Tennis rackets and volleyballs. And slap fights. And beach offs. Yes. Oh, yeah.

All those in favor of letting Barbie Land be Barbie Land, say “Aye.” [Barbies] Aye! [all cheering] [uplifting music playing] I’m so happy. [Barbies chanting] Go, Barbie! Go, Barbie! Go, Barbie! Go, Barbie! Go, Barbie! Go, Barbie! Go, Barbie! Go, Barbie! [Kens galloping] Is it just my imagination, or did these Mojo Dojo Casa Houses just get dreamier? That’s because they’re Dreamhouses, mother… [bleep]. [Kens gasp] [President Barbie] That’s right. We’ve reinstated the Barbie Land Constitution to what it should be. And restored all the Barbies’ brains and autonomy. [Barbies cheering] Yes! And we seriously disinfected those houses. What do we do? [Ken breathing heavily] [in deep voice] Kens! Who are we attacking, sir? No… [Ken chuckles nervously] No… [cries dramatically] Don’t look at me! [whispering] Is he crying? Just give us a minute. [Ken sobbing in distance] [breath shudders] Ken. [continues sobbing] Are you okay? Yeah. Totally. [Barbie] It’s okay if you’re crying. You know, I cried too. It’s actually kind of amazing. [Ken] I’m a liberated man. I know crying is not weak. [Barbie] Okay. [crying softly] You wanna sit up for a minute? [grunts] [sighs] This, uh… It was hard running stuff. I didn’t love it. [cries] I get it. [exhales] And those mini-fridges are so small. [Barbie] Mm-hmm. You could only fit a six pack in them. [crying] And the freezers are basically useless. To be honest, when I found out that patriarchy wasn’t about horses, I lost interest anyway. That’s okay. [sniffles] I always thought this would be our house. [chuckles] Oh. [Ken sobs loudly] Ken. [sobbing and muttering] I think I owe you an apology. Huh? I’m really sorry I took you for granted. Oh. Not every night had to be girls’ night. [sighs] Thank you for saying that. [sniffles] Thank you. Oh. I didn’t mean to suggest, uh… I just don’t know who I am without you. You’re Ken. But it’s “Barbie and Ken.” There is no just “Ken.” That’s why I was created. I only exist within the warmth of your gaze. Without it, I’m just another blond guy who can’t do flips. [dramatic music plays] [grunts] [crowd gasps] [gasping] Maybe it’s time to discover who Ken is. Okay. I think I get it now. Okay. [chuckles] No, no, no! This isn’t the answer. [smacks] [crowd gasps] [Ken] I feel so stupid. [Pompadour Ken] No. [Tall Ken] No. [crying] I look so stupid. [Barbies] Yeah. I look so stupid! No! [crying] So cool. You look so cool. Okay. Ken, you have to figure out who you are without me. [sighs] Why? You’re not your girlfriend. You’re not your house, you’re not your mink. Beach? [Barbie] Nope. You’re not even beach. Maybe all the things that you thought made you you aren’t… really you. Maybe it’s Barbie and… it’s Ken. Ken is… me? Yes. Ken is me! And I’m Barbie. [soft uplifting music playing] Ken… is me! Ken is me! Ken is me! Ken is me! [Ken laughs] I don’t even care about being Ken anymore. I just miss my friend Barbie! That’s cool! Barbie! [gasps] I’m right here. Ken! [ding] [dramatic musical sting] I want you to have it. Aw. That’s nice. [sentimental music playing] We were only fighting because we didn’t know who we were. Ken is me! [laughing] [Mattel CEO laughing] Ken is right. It’s just so hard to be a leader. You know? That’s my boss. It’s… [screams] Oh. Midge, gosh. I thought we discontinued her. [panting] Look, do you know how many times I’ve wanted to stand up in a board meeting and just say, “Can we just tickle each other?” Really? Let’s have a company retreat and just tickle each other. [executives laughing] Someone get me. Someone get me. [all laughing] I love being tickled. [Kens laugh] No, no, no. Don’t hug me. Don’t hug me. [sighs] But thanks to the Barbies, I, too, can now relieve myself of this heavy existential burden while holding on to the very real title of CEO. And we can restore everything in Barbie Land to exactly the way it was. Mister Mattel, I just… Please. Call me Mother. No, thank you. I don’t think that things should go back to the way that they were. No Barbie or Ken should be living in the shadows. Or Allan. Hey. Me? Yeah. Oh. Hello. I just want to say, I’m sorry we called you Weird Barbie behind your back and also to your face. That’s okay. I’m owning it. Would you like a job in my cabinet? May I please have sanitation? It’s yours. Yeah, thank you. [President Barbie] All right. Madam President. Oh. Please, may the Kens have one Supreme Court Justice? Oh, I can’t do that. But maybe a lower circuit court judgeship. We accept. As long as we can wear robes. [narrator] Well, the Kens have to start somewhere. And one day, the Kens will have as much power and influence in Barbie Land as women have in the Real World. No, I don’t want to. Just go! I can’t. Grow up and go. I have an idea. Tell me your secret dream, child. Okay, what about Ordinary Barbie? She’s not extraordinary. She’s not president of anything, or maybe she is. Maybe she’s a mom. Maybe she’s not. Because it’s okay to just want to be a mom, or to wanna be president or a mom who is president. Or not a mom who’s also not president. She just has a flattering top, and she wants to get through the day feeling kinda good about herself. That’s a terrible idea. Yeah, that’s going to make money. Oh. Ordinary Barbie. I love it. Fantastic. Okay, great. Great. Cool. Yes. We good? I think we’re good, right? All right, let’s begin the work to close the portal between our two worlds. Hey, what about Barbie? What do you mean? [crowd] Yeah, what about Barbie? What’s her ending? What does she get? Well, that’s easy. She’s in love with Ken. [crowd] Aw. That is not her ending. [groans in frustration] I’m not in love with Ken. [crowd] Oh. What do you want? I don’t know. I’m… I’m not really sure where I belong anymore. I don’t think I have an ending. [Ruth] That was always the point. I created you so you wouldn’t have an ending. It’s you. You’re Ruth from Mattel. Baby, I am Mattel. Until the IRS got to me, but that’s another movie. So, you’re… Ruth Handler. Inventor of Barbie. [crowd gasps] What? That’s so cool. Her ghost keeps an office on the 17th floor. [Ruth] What? What? [Ruth] You guys, you think the lady who invented Barbie looks like Barbie? [laughing] I’m a five-foot-nothing grandma with a double mastectomy… and tax evasion issues. [laughing] Nobody looks like Barbie, except, of course, Barbie. Take a bow, honey. I don’t really feel like Barbie anymore. Come, walk with me. [solemn music playing] Thank you. Thank you, Barbie. Thank you. I’m not really sure what I’m supposed to do now. I’ve always been Stereotypical Barbie, and I don’t think I’m really good at anything else. You saved Barbie Land from patriarchy. That was very much a group effort. And you helped that mother and daughter connect. They really helped each other. Maybe you’re Self-Effacing Barbie? Maybe I’m not Barbie anymore. You understand that humans only have one ending. Ideas live forever, humans not so much. You know that, right? I do. Being a human can be pretty uncomfortable. I know. Humans make things up like patriarchy and Barbie just to deal with how uncomfortable it is. I understand that. And then you die. [chuckles softly] Yeah. Yeah. I want to be a part of the people that make meaning. Not the thing that’s made. I want to do the imagining. I don’t wanna be the idea. Does that make sense? I always knew that Barbie would surprise me, but I never expected this. Do you give me permission to become human? You don’t need my permission. But you’re the creator. You… Don’t you control me? [Ruth] I can’t control you any more than I can control my own daughter. I named you after her, Barbara. And I always hoped for you like I hoped for her. We mothers stand still so our daughters can look back to see how far they’ve come. So, being human’s not something I need to… ask for or even want? I can just… It’s something that I just discover I am? I can’t in good conscience let you take this leap without you knowing what it means. Take my hands. Now close your eyes.

treated like outcasts due to their unconventional traits while the kens spend their days playing at the beach considering it as their profession the barbies hold prestigious jobs such as doctors lawyers and politicians beach ken ken is only happy when he is with barbie and seeks a closer relationship but barbie rebuffs him in favor of other activities and female friendships     since the beginning of time since the first little girl ever existed there have been dolls but the dolls were always and forever baby dolls the girls who played with them could only ever play at being mothers which can be fun at least for a while anyway ask your mother this continued until     yes barbie changed everything then she changed it all again all of these women are barbie and barbie is all of these women she might have started out as just a lady in a bathing suit but she became so much more she has her own money her own house her own car her own career because barbie can be anything women can be anything and this has been reflected back onto the little girls of today in the real world girls can grow into women who can achieve everything and anything they set their mind to thanks to barbie all problems of feminism and equal rights have been solved at least thats what the barbies think after all theyre living in barbie land who am i to burst their bubble and here is one of those barbies now living her best day every day   when i wake up   in my own pink world   i get up out of bed and wave to my homegirls   hey barbie hey   shes so cool   all dolled up   just playing chess by

unfolding events but some things have been happening that might be related  bad breath this morning a cold shower burnt waffle and falling off my roof  youre malfunctioning what no im just im am i ive never seen this kind of malfunction before its usually just hairrelated you know youre gonna have to visit weird barbie i have never had to visit weird barbie thats because youve never malfunctioned i heard that she used to be the most beautiful barbie of all but then someone played with her too hard in the real world   colors of the world   spice up your life   every boy and every girl   spice up your life   people of the world   spice up your life   ahh   slam me to the left   if youre having a good time   shake it to the right  and now shes fated to an eternity of making other barbies perfect while falling more and more into disrepair herself that and we all call her weird barbie both behind her back and also to her face shes so weird why is she always in the splits   i would never wear heels if my feet were shaped this way hello woof  oh  bark  woof bark hey whats cookin goodlookin hi welcome welcome to my weirdhouse  hi how are ya nice to meet you sorry about the dog crap what can i do ya for i just had to come see you about my feet theyre um flat yeah never seen that before really whoa okay well can you you know fix them youre stereotypical barbie right mmmhmm  that ken of yours he is one nicelooking little protein pot i guess id like to see what kind of nude blob hes packing under those jeans  anyway what preceded this oh nothing a really fun game of volleyball thats it thoughts of death what is it  maybe some thoughts of death thoughts of death is that a problem oh what ive heard of this of course i didnt think it was possible but its real oh youve done it youve opened a portal i didnt open a portal  someone did and now there is a rip in the continuum that is the membrane between barbie land and the real world and if you wanna be stereotypical barbie perfect again then baby girl you gotta go fix it or youre gonna keep going funny look at your upper thigh  what is that thats cellulite thats gonna spread everywhere what and then youre gonna start getting sad and mushy and complicated no  what do i have to do you have to go to the real world okay and you have to find the girl whos playing with you playing with me were all being played with babe but usually theres some kind of separation thanks theres the girl and the doll and never the twain shall cross the twain is crossing yes and the girl whos playing with you she must be sad and her thoughts and feelings and humanness are interfering with your dollness why would she be sad we fixed everything so that all women in the real world can be happy and powerful i dont know but if you ask me you had something to do with this too me takes two to rip a portal i cant have ive only ever wanted for everything to stay exactly as it is well be that as it may the two of you are becoming inextricably intertwined and you gotta help her to help yourself  so should whoo so whatll it be then you can go back to your regular life and forget any of this ever happened or you can know the truth about the universe the choice is now yours the first one the high heel no well do a redo youre supposed to want to know i dont mmm babe listen you have to want to know okay do it again im not adventure barbie im stereotypical barbie im like the barbie you think of when someone says think of a barbie thats me im bummed youre a bummer thats a bummer okay im ready to forget now no youre doing this one i just gave you a choice so you could feel some sense of control so there is no option one no you have to fix the rip yourself dont blame me blame mattel they make the rules  oh i dont want to fine get cellulite i dont care no no no no no okay yeah  send me through the portal okay theres actually no portal oh its a figure of speech its actually a sports car to a speedboat to a rocket ship to a tandem bike to a camper van fun to a snowmobile brr which will take you most of the way to the state of los angeles where you will don neon and rollerblades and enter the country of california weird i know best if you dont think about it too much and then when i get there how do i find this girl you will know okay and how do i get back the same way you came but in reverse like i should move forward but do the order backward or go dont overthink it oh okay for you see if you do not find her and fix things whats ugly will become uglier and whats weird will become weirder and then youll look like me ahh oh sorry i understand i set myself up for that anyway i believe in you thank you go be careful i love you bye bye  bon voyage to reality and good luck restoring the membrane that separates our world from theirs so you dont get cellulite  i guess shes going without you youre so lost ken  she literally asked me and i was like i prefer to stay here why are you scared no  i bet youre scared and i bet she doesnt even want you to go well you bet both those things incorrectly and i bet in the opposite direction yeah yeah which way is that you dont even know i just dont want to leave im trying to find reasons not to leave please stay im gonna miss you guys so much i just wish someone could come with me but you cant i should do this alone what bird am i thinking of parrot dolphin i mean no a bird pelican ohh man well miss you barbie  ill be back in no time with perfect feet and well forget that this ever happened and youll get to see all the good work weve done to fix the world youll be such a hero to them all those grateful powerful women who owe their wonderful lives to barbie ill bet every woman will say thank you and give you a really big hug  yes youre right here i go bye yay bye barbie bye   bye barbie good luck in reality watch for cellulite    i went to the doctor i went to the mountains   i looked to the children i drank from the fountains   theres more than one answer

that is nobody nobodys dream and thats barbie barbie of course shes not dead shes just having an existential crisis  okay come on hey whats wrong  im not pretty anymore what youre so pretty im not stereotypical barbie pretty  note to the filmmakers margot robbie is the wrong person to cast if you want to make this point but youre beautiful its not just that im not smart enough to be interesting youre so smart i cant do brain surgery ive never flown a plane  im not the president no one on the supreme court is me im not good enough for anything  it is literally impossible to be a woman you are so beautiful and so smart and it kills me that you dont think youre good enough like we have to always be extraordinary but somehow were always doing it wrong  you have to be thin but not too thin and you can never say you want to be thin you have to say you want to be healthy but also you have to be thin you have to have money but you cant ask for money because thats crass  you have to be a boss but you cant be mean you have to lead but you cant squash other peoples ideas youre supposed to love being a mother but dont talk about your kids all the damn time you have to be a career woman but also always be looking out for other people you have to answer for mens bad behavior which is insane but if you point that out youre accused of complaining youre supposed to stay pretty for men but not so pretty that you tempt them too much or that you threaten other women because youre supposed to be a part of the sisterhood but always stand out and always be grateful but never forget that the system is rigged so find a way to acknowledge that but also always be grateful you have to never get old never be rude never show off never be selfish never fall down never fail never show fear never get out of line its too hard its too contradictory and nobody gives you a medal or says thank you and it turns out in fact that not only are you doing everything wrong but also everything is your fault  im just so tired of watching myself and every single other woman tie herself into knots so that people will like us and if all of that is also true for a doll just representing a woman then i dont even know wait i did write a book its like ive been in a dream where i was somehow really invested in the zack snyder cut of justice league but what you said broke me out of it really yeah youre back shes back by giving voice to the cognitive dissonance required to be a woman under the patriarchy you robbed it of its power yes wow i just said all of that hell yes white savior barbie no it was your mom your mom did the saving we have to stop the kens and you need to say all of those things to the other barbies thats the key got it but how are we gonna get the barbies away from their kens we have experience with a world like this one do you have a map of barbie land what do you think  wow  thanks i built it okay heres the deal its not just about how they see us its about how they see themselves ken land contains the seeds of its own destruction first we have to get the barbies away from their kens we could use a decoy barbie who pretends to be brainwashed that should be you cool   distract them by appearing helpless and confused kens cannot resist a damsel in distress  you have to make them believe that youre complacent that they have the power and when their guard is down you take the power back the influence that porsche  has had on the motoring world as a whole it cant be overstated oh photoshop is so hard i just dont understand how to use the select tool honey you can only use the select tool if the layer is highlighted let me show you my tiny head is just swimming with technical jargon like color bands oh hi and magnetic lassos and bit maps do you think that you and your strong arms can explain oh whats happening  allan go around  ahh oh but what about ken no no no no but i love him  come on allan  hey whats gonna happen to ken  just listen you have to be their mommies but not remind them of their mommy any power you have must be masked under a giggle  what happened one minute i was president and the next i was cutting a ken steak for him welcome back madam president then well recruit the now unbrainwashed barbies to our cause  they can be the new decoys  you can tell him that youve never seen the godfather and that youd love them to explain it to you ooh are you guys watching the godfather the godfather ive never seen it oh my god youve never seen the godfather this movie is a rich blend of coppolas aesthetic genius and a triumph for robert evans and the architecture of the  studio system  can you start the movie over and just talk through the whole thing you have to find a way to reject mens advances without damaging their egos because if you say yes to them youre a tramp but if you say no to them youre a prude  i dont wanna touch a foot no you dont another one be confused about money i just have all my money in a savings account thats totally wrong you need treasury bonds corporate bonds cds no one has cds anymore oh sweetheart you are so cute when youre confused but no not music cd stands for certificate of deposit stephen malkmus really harnessed the acerbic talksinging of lou reed with postpunk influences such as wire and the fall  what am i wearing i would never choose this because youre a physicist do you want some pants yeah   welcome back barbie gee i am so awkward and dont feel pretty at all and will anyone ever like me  or distract them with the old standby wearing glasses so they can discover that youre pretty may i sure go ahead there now we can see your beautiful face and then theres pretending to be terrible at every sport ever here let me show you here let me show you here let me show you here let me show you  here let us show you well do this until every single barbie is deprogrammed and ready to take back barbie land yes yes yeah  hey tomorrow the kens vote to change the constitution so we have to get there first the final stage of our plan to turn the kens against each other now that they think they have power over you you make them question whether they have enough power over each other what if this doesnt work what if he doesnt like me anymore he likes you he was really upset because he likes you and because he knows deep down that you dont like him the same way it still doesnt mean i want to hurt him he took your house he brainwashed your friends he wants to control the government true  girl yeah wow yeah its like im a woman already  welcome is this what its like  its time im ready thank you here i go  hi    ahh  oh hey youve caught me reading oh ive been thinking mmhmm  ken land kendom kendom kendom land land of the land of the free and the men right well this place is  kendom land really great and the kens really are just better at ruling than the barbies ever were well we just took patriarchy and you know made a patriarchy yeah well i was thinking yes im ready to be your longtermdistance lowcommitment casual girlfriend if youll still have me would you just hold on for one second  oh okay  sublime i dont know im gonna have to think about that  oh

me   we might change yeah   yeah we just might feel good    i wanna push you around   well i will well i will   i wanna push you down   well i will well i will   this is the final stage of our plan give them their dream come true and at the peak of their happiness when they think you actually care about this song  you take it all away  i will    who are you texting  huh who are you texting no

half minutes i would love that   baby  sorry one sec  i wanna push you around  be right back  well i will well i will i wanna push   you play on their egos and their petty jealousies and you turn them

do we do we beach every individual one of them off  no we go to war against the barbies no against the kens but we are the kens the other kens we should probably call them something else so it doesnt get confusing no because well know what we mean but when were on the battlefield and you say ken at four oclock how will i know if you mean us kens or the other kens because my dudes we attack at ten oclock and take advantage of the morning waves but not so early cause were gonna want to sleep in right but what will we fight with we have no guns tennis rackets and volleyballs and slap fights and

tickle each other really lets have a company retreat and just tickle each other  someone get me someone get me  i love being tickled  no no no dont hug me dont hug me  but thanks to the barbies i too can now relieve myself of this heavy existential burden while holding on to the very real title of ceo and we can restore everything in barbie land to exactly the way it was mister mattel i just please call me mother no thank you i dont think that things should go back to the way that they were no barbie or ken should be living in the shadows or allan hey me yeah oh hello i just want to say im sorry we called you weird barbie behind your back and also to your face thats okay im owning it would you like a job in my cabinet may i please have sanitation its yours yeah thank you  all right madam president oh please may the kens have one supreme court justice oh i cant do that but maybe a lower circuit court judgeship we accept as long as we can wear robes  well the kens have to start somewhere and one day the kens will have as much power and influence in barbie land as women have in the real world no i dont want to just go i cant grow up and go i have an idea tell me your secret dream child okay what about ordinary barbie shes not extraordinary shes not president of anything or maybe she is maybe shes a mom maybe shes not because its okay to just want to be a mom or to wanna be president or a mom who is president or not a mom whos also not president she just has a flattering top and she wants to get through the day feeling kinda good about herself thats a terrible idea yeah thats going to make money oh ordinary barbie i love it fantastic okay great great cool yes we good i think were good right all right lets begin the work to close the portal between our two worlds hey what about barbie what do you mean  yeah what about barbie whats her ending what does she get well thats easy shes in love with ken  aw that is not her ending  im not in love with ken  oh what do you want i dont know im im not really sure where i belong anymore i dont think i have an ending  that was always the point i created you so you wouldnt have an ending its you youre ruth from mattel baby i am mattel until the irs got to me but thats another movie so youre ruth handler inventor of barbie  what thats so cool her ghost keeps an office on the  floor  what what  you guys you think the lady who invented barbie looks like barbie  im a fivefootnothing grandma with a double mastectomy and tax evasion issues  nobody looks like barbie except of course barbie take a bow honey i dont really feel like barbie anymore come walk with me  thank you thank you barbie thank you im not really sure what im supposed to do now ive always been stereotypical barbie and i dont think im really good at anything else you saved barbie land from patriarchy that was very much a group effort and you helped that mother and daughter connect they really helped each other maybe youre selfeffacing barbie maybe im not barbie anymore you understand that humans only have one ending ideas live forever humans not so much you know that right i do being a human can be pretty uncomfortable i know humans make things up like patriarchy and barbie just to deal with how uncomfortable it is i understand that and then you die  yeah yeah i want to be a part of the people that make meaning not the thing thats made i want to do the imagining i dont wanna be the idea does that make sense i always knew that barbie would surprise me but i never expected this do you give me permission to become

              "'stereotypical barbie barbie and fellow dolls reside in barbieland a matriarchal society with different variations of barbies kens and a group of discontinued models who are treated like outcasts due to their unconventional traits while the kens spend their days playing at the beach considering it as their profession the barbies hold prestigious jobs such as doctors lawyers and politicians beach ken ken is only happy when he is with barbie and seeks a closer relationship but barbie rebuffs him in favor of other activities and female friendships     since the beginning of time since the first little girl ever existed there have been dolls but the dolls were always and forever baby dolls the girls who played with them could only ever play at being mothers which can be fun at least for a while anyway ask your mother this continued until     yes barbie changed everything then she changed it all again all of these women are barbie and barbie is all of these women she might have started out as just a lady in a bathing suit but she became so much more she has her own money her own house her own car her own career because barbie can be anything women can be anything and this has been reflected back onto the little girls of today in the real world girls can grow into women who can achieve everything and anything they set their mind to thanks to barbie all problems of feminism and equal rights have been solved at least thats what the barbies think after all theyre living in barbie land who am i to burst their bubble and here is one of those barbies now living

been happening that might be related  bad breath this morning a cold shower burnt waffle and falling off my roof  youre malfunctioning what no im just im am i ive never seen this kind of malfunction before its usually just hairrelated you know youre gonna have to visit weird barbie i have never had to visit weird barbie thats because youve never malfunctioned i heard that she used to be the most beautiful barbie of all but then someone played with her too hard in the real world   colors of the world   spice up your life   every boy and every girl   spice up your life   people of the world   spice up your life   ahh   slam me to the left   if youre having a good time   shake it to the right  and now shes fated to an eternity of making other barbies perfect while falling more and more into disrepair herself that and we all call her weird barbie both behind her back and also to her face shes so weird why is she always in the splits   i would never wear heels if my feet were shaped this way hello woof  oh  bark  woof bark hey whats cookin goodlookin hi welcome welcome to my weirdhouse  hi how are ya nice to meet you sorry about the dog crap what can i do ya for i just had to come see

protein pot i guess id like to see what kind of nude blob hes packing under those jeans  anyway what preceded this oh nothing a really fun game of volleyball thats it thoughts of death what is it  maybe some thoughts of death thoughts of death is that a problem oh what ive heard of this of course i didnt think it was possible but its real oh youve done it youve opened a portal i didnt open a portal  someone did and now there is a rip in the continuum that is the membrane between barbie land and the real world and if you wanna be stereotypical barbie perfect again then baby girl you gotta go fix it or youre gonna keep going funny look at your upper thigh  what is that thats cellulite thats gonna spread everywhere what and then youre gonna start getting sad and mushy and complicated no  what do i have to do you have to go to the real world okay and you have to find the girl whos playing with you playing with me were all being played with babe but usually theres some kind of separation thanks theres the girl and the doll and never the twain shall cross the twain is crossing yes and the girl whos playing with you she must be sad and her thoughts and feelings and humanness are interfering with your dollness why would she be sad we fixed everything so that all women in the real world can be happy and powerful i dont know but if you ask me you had something to do with this too me takes two to rip a portal i cant have ive only ever wanted for everything to stay exactly as it is well be that as it may the two of you are becoming inextricably intertwined and you gotta help her to help yourself  so should whoo so whatll it be then you can go back to your regular life and forget any of this ever happened or you can know the truth about the universe the choice is now yours the first one the high heel no well do a redo youre supposed to want to know i dont mmm babe listen you have to want to know okay do it again im not adventure barbie im stereotypical barbie im like the barbie you think of when someone says think of a barbie thats me im bummed youre a bummer thats a bummer okay im ready to forget now no youre doing this one i just gave you a choice so you could feel some sense of control so there is no option one no you have to fix the rip yourself dont blame me blame mattel they make the rules  oh i dont want to fine get cellulite i dont care no no no no no okay yeah  send me through the portal okay theres actually no portal oh its a figure of speech its actually a sports car to a speedboat to a rocket ship to a tandem bike to a camper van fun to a snowmobile brr which will take you most of the way to the state of los angeles where you will don neon and rollerblades and enter the country of california weird i know best if you dont think about it too much and then when i get there how do i find this girl you will know okay and how do i get back the same way you came but in reverse like i should move forward but do the order backward or go dont overthink it oh okay for you see if you do not find her and fix things whats ugly will become uglier and whats weird will become weirder and then youll look like me ahh oh sorry i understand i set myself up for that anyway i believe in you thank you go be careful i love you bye bye  bon voyage to reality and good luck restoring the membrane that separates our world from theirs so you dont get cellulite  i guess shes going without you youre so lost ken  she literally asked me and i was like i prefer to stay here why are you scared no  i bet youre scared and i bet she doesnt even want you to go well you bet both those things incorrectly and i bet in the opposite direction yeah yeah which way is that you dont even know i just dont want to leave im trying to find reasons not to leave please stay im gonna miss you guys so much i just wish someone could come with me but you cant i should do this alone what bird am i thinking of parrot dolphin i mean no a bird pelican ohh man well miss you barbie  ill be back in no time with perfect feet and well forget that this ever happened and youll get to see all the good work weve done to fix the world youll be such a hero to them all those grateful powerful women who owe their wonderful lives to barbie ill bet every woman will say thank you and give you a really big hug  yes youre right here i go bye yay bye barbie bye   bye barbie good luck in reality watch for cellulite    i went to the doctor i went to the mountains   i looked to the children i drank from the fountains   theres more than one answer to these questions   pointing me

hello hello hello hello are you two like shining no no its nothing like that are you shining with a real barbie no i mean maybe like a little yes  i dont even know where to start with this

always rollerblading  excuse me sir theyve gone to barbie land oh no and shes brought humans there with her this could mean extremely weird things for our world like what nothing any of our collective imaginations could ever dream up a podcast hosted by two wise trees or a choir of  young fathers not even close weve got to get to barbie land go find some blades now just pick a direction and run i can practically feel my heels lifting already yes this is what i was supposed to do bring you back here it feels right it does okay this is oh thats strange     cause thats the man i am   baby treat

elevate the presence of men thats amazing thats beautiful i know  barbies here  uhoh ken  what have you done what are you wearing dont question it just roll with it tiny baby  tiny baby dont call me

that is nobody nobodys dream and thats barbie barbie of course shes not dead shes just having an existential crisis  okay come on hey whats wrong  im not pretty anymore what youre so pretty im not stereotypical barbie pretty  note to the filmmakers margot robbie is the wrong person to cast if you want to make this point but youre beautiful its not just that im not smart enough to be interesting youre so smart i cant do brain surgery ive never flown a plane  im not the president no one on the supreme court is me im not good enough for anything  it is literally impossible to be a woman you are so beautiful and so smart and it kills me that you dont think youre good enough like we have to always be extraordinary but somehow were always doing it wrong  you have to be thin but not too thin and you can never say you want to be thin you have to say you want to be healthy but also you have to be thin you have to have money but you cant ask for money because thats crass  you have to be a boss but you cant be mean you have to lead but you cant squash other peoples ideas youre supposed to love being a mother but dont talk about your kids all the damn time you have to be a career woman but also always be looking out for other people you have to answer for mens bad behavior which is insane but if you point that out youre accused of complaining youre supposed to stay pretty for men but not so pretty that you tempt them too much or that you threaten other women because youre supposed to be a part of the sisterhood but always stand out and always be grateful but never forget that the system is rigged so find a way to acknowledge that but also always be grateful you have to never get old never be rude never show off never be selfish never fall down never fail never show fear never get out of line its too hard its too contradictory and nobody gives you a medal or says thank you and it turns out in fact that not only are you doing everything wrong but also everything is your fault  im just so tired of watching myself and every single other woman tie herself into knots so that people will like us and if all of that is also true for a doll just representing a woman then i dont even know wait i did write a book its like ive been in a dream where i was somehow really invested in the zack snyder cut of justice league but what you said broke me out of it really yeah youre back shes back by giving voice to the cognitive dissonance required to be a woman under the patriarchy you robbed it of its power yes wow i just said all of that hell yes white savior barbie no it was your mom your mom did the saving we have to stop the kens and you need to say all of those things to the other barbies thats the key got it but how are we gonna get the barbies away from their kens we have experience with a world like this one do you have a map of barbie land what do you think  wow  thanks i built it okay heres the deal its not just about how they see us its about how they see themselves ken land contains the seeds of its own destruction first we have to get the barbies away from their kens we could use a decoy barbie who pretends to be brainwashed that should be you cool   distract them by appearing helpless and confused kens cannot resist a damsel in distress  you have to make them believe that youre complacent that they have the power and when their guard is down you take the power back the influence that porsche  has had on the motoring world as a whole it cant be overstated oh photoshop is so hard i just dont understand how to use the select tool honey you can only use the select tool if the layer is highlighted let me show you my tiny head is just swimming with technical jargon like color bands oh hi and magnetic lassos and bit maps do you think that you and your strong arms can explain oh whats happening  allan go around  ahh oh but what about ken no no no no but i love him  come on allan  hey whats gonna happen to ken  just listen you have to be their mommies but not remind them of their mommy any power you have must be masked under a giggle  what happened one minute i was president and the next i was cutting a ken steak for him welcome back madam president then well recruit the now unbrainwashed barbies to our cause  they can be the new decoys  you can tell him that youve never seen the godfather and that youd love them to explain it to you ooh are you guys watching the godfather the godfather ive never seen it oh my god youve never seen the godfather this movie is a rich blend of coppolas aesthetic genius and a triumph for robert evans and the architecture of the  studio system  can you start the movie over and just talk through the whole thing you have to find a way to reject mens advances without damaging their egos because if you say yes to them youre a tramp but if you say no to them youre a prude  i dont wanna touch a foot no you dont another one be confused about money i just have all my money in a savings account thats totally wrong you need treasury bonds corporate bonds cds no one has cds anymore oh sweetheart you are so cute when youre confused but no not music cd stands for certificate of deposit stephen malkmus really harnessed the acerbic talksinging of lou reed with postpunk influences such as wire and the fall  what am i wearing i would never choose this because youre a physicist do you want some pants yeah   welcome back barbie gee i am so awkward and dont feel pretty at all and will anyone ever like me  or distract them with the old standby wearing glasses so they can discover that youre pretty may i sure go ahead there now we can see your beautiful face and then theres pretending to be terrible at every sport ever here let me show you here let me show you here let me show you here let me show you  here let us show you well do this until every single barbie is deprogrammed and ready to take back barbie land yes yes yeah  hey tomorrow the kens vote to change the constitution so we have to get there first the final stage of our plan to turn the kens against each other now that they think they have power over you you make them question whether they have enough power over each other what if this doesnt work what if he doesnt like me anymore he likes you he was really upset because he likes you and because he knows deep down that you dont like him the same way it still doesnt mean i want to hurt him he took your house he brainwashed your friends he wants to control the government true  girl yeah wow yeah its like im a woman already  welcome is this what its like  its time im ready thank you here i go  hi    ahh  oh hey youve caught me reading oh ive been thinking mmhmm  ken land kendom kendom kendom land land of the land of the free and the men right well this place is  kendom land really great and the kens really are just better at ruling than the barbies ever were well we just took patriarchy and you know made a patriarchy yeah well i was thinking yes im
